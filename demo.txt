6/21/23, 00:08 - üï∑Ô∏è: Hey, I am Madhav Kumar, a senior at IIT Delhi pursuing Btech in Engineering Physics with a minor in CS.
Been doing development on all fronts for the past 4 years, recently dived into the LLM Space.
- Have tried all sorts of things with Langchain, the typical pdf-chatbot, youtubeVid-chatbot,etc.
- I'm making a bot which scans a github repo and automatically rasies issues based on its interpretation  
- With another friend from my uni @919699149064 , I am making this product which basically renders a product handbook given a startup idea ( can be generalized to anything literally )
 ( ETA 3 weeks )

I am looking to collaborate with fellow devs in this space, do hmu
6/21/23, 00:16 - +91 97735 87257: Hello all, Aayush here, currently ML engineer at a startup that makes tech products for entrepreneurs (who give their idea, and we bring it to fruition for them: feel free to dm me if you need our services).  

My work there is to find the scope for integrating AI into the products. 
We are also looking to build something for our own.
I am excited to work on instruction tuned, fine tuned LLMs, Langchain, computer vision, et. al.

Kudos to @919891901981 for bringing us all together to learn, share our learnings and build a great professional network.
6/21/23, 00:17 - +91 76820 77931: Hi Aayush
6/21/23, 00:22 - +91 99105 48139: Langchain question: can langchain query a database (MySQL or mongo) ? Use case: user prompt "what is the sales in Q1" , this goes to LLM and may be to langchain and fetch data from Database?
6/21/23, 00:22 - +91 99105 48139: Is this doable?
6/21/23, 00:23 - +91 91984 58986: Something like this?

6/21/23, 00:29 - +91 62393 05919: Hello everyone, right now I am ML intern working on CV and side by side I am interested in learning about LLM's could anyone suggest some good in-depth resources, as on YouTube the resources are sort of introductory.
6/21/23, 00:31 - +91 88103 86510: You can try fast.ai courses

6/21/23, 10:22 - +91 98919 01981: What does everyone prefer for production level AI apps

Langchain or LlamaIndex

What is your reason?
6/21/23, 10:23 - +91 90290 81083: I was listening to a podcast by Greg liu and weaviate today... LlamaIndex has some sort of ability to create a graph of document chunks which helps retain the overall structure... Interesting idea
6/21/23, 10:24 - +91 98919 01981: I felt LlamaIndex is good for chat with data apps and Langchain for agents but would like to know what others say
6/21/23, 10:24 - +91 90290 81083: Also LlamaIndex has some support for integrating with langchain
6/21/23, 10:25 - +91 90290 81083: LlamaIndex may have some advantages if dealing with large docs if this graph index thing works
6/21/23, 10:25 - +91 98919 01981: One problem with LlamaIndex though is there is no js support, so hosting it is a problem
6/21/23, 10:26 - +91 90290 81083: Yes... That's there... I'm learning Pynecone so that might help

6/21/23, 10:27 - +91 97246 54616: We want to build app that generates MCQ questions in our regional languages based on given prompt, then which one would be better to go with, LangChain or LlamaIndex ?
6/21/23, 10:28 - +91 98919 01981: Langchain is easier with prompt template which you can use
6/21/23, 10:36 - +91 63695 89236: Can provide link

6/21/23, 11:06 - +91 99712 24643: Is anyone in this group making efforts into other AI fields other than generative/LLMs? The whole lot of innovation and engineering today is focused on generative AI, would love to see if anyone is creating something significant in another field?
6/21/23, 11:06 - +91 90031 35354: +1
6/21/23, 11:55 - +91 63695 89236: anyone used vectera? apparently their serach is better than other vector similarity seraches.
6/21/23, 11:56 - +91 96600 03707: Hey everyone, isn't midjourney available for trial or we need to purchase the basic plan for using it?
6/21/23, 11:56 - +91 63695 89236: we are still looking for experienced reactjs/nodejs devs for full time positions. pm me if interested. thanks
6/21/23, 11:56 - +91 88103 86510: You can use playgroundai.com for free
6/21/23, 11:56 - +91 88103 86510: It has many models and many powerful features
6/21/23, 11:57 - +91 98119 06112: It's on paid membership now you can try genvr labs
6/21/23, 11:57 - +91 92050 66063: Its not available for trial anymore

6/21/23, 12:02 - +91 88103 86510: Ok
6/21/23, 12:04 - +91 96600 03707: How does playgroundai.com compare with midjourney
6/21/23, 12:05 - +91 89290 90206: This is just a playground. Where you can select an open source model, run it with different options
6/21/23, 12:06 - +91 89290 90206: Midjourney has it's own internal tool which is not available open source
6/21/23, 12:06 - +91 96600 03707: Okk got it
6/21/23, 12:07 - +91 89290 90206: There is an open source alternative to Midjourney
6/21/23, 12:07 - +91 89290 90206: Which is called Open Journey
6/21/23, 12:07 - +91 73877 90163: Stable Diffusion Is Also Open Source Na?
6/21/23, 12:07 - +91 89290 90206: Where they have trained on Midjourney images
6/21/23, 12:07 - +91 89290 90206: Yes

6/21/23, 12:08 - +91 73877 90163: Yup, One The Best Image Generation Tool I Have Ever Seen By Stability AI
6/21/23, 12:08 - +91 89290 90206: Open source Midjourney or Open Journey
6/21/23, 12:08 - +91 89290 90206: is trained on outputs of Midjourney
6/21/23, 12:08 - +91 89290 90206: And as per many surpasses Midjourney
6/21/23, 12:09 - +91 89290 90206: And free for anyone to use
6/21/23, 12:11 - +91 73877 90163: Recently Getty Images Fired A Case against stable Diffusion for using their pics to train the diffusion modelüíÄ
6/21/23, 12:14 - +91 89290 90206: Yes, not just Getty images. Midjourney and Stable Diffusion is sued by many artists globally

6/21/23, 12:17 - +91 89290 90206: Yes, Midjourney's revenue is 200 M USD per year. Higher than Chat GPT
6/21/23, 12:17 - +91 89290 90206: or Open AI
6/21/23, 12:21 - +91 96600 03707: @918929090206 Just curious was the cost of computing and running the model was more than the 200 M USD ?

6/21/23, 12:23 - +91 89290 90206: No, Midjourney gives 3.3 GPU hours for 10$
6/21/23, 12:23 - +91 89290 90206: A10 machines cost 1.3$ per hour
6/21/23, 12:23 - +91 89290 90206: So you can compare
6/21/23, 12:24 - +91 89290 90206: Plus you don't need A10 machines anyways. 16 GB ones work well
6/21/23, 12:24 - +91 96600 03707: @918929090206 got it
6/21/23, 12:24 - +91 89290 90206: With 3 year commitment, $0.160 per GPU

6/21/23, 12:25 - +91 96600 03707: I see that they give only limited generations in the basic plan right around 200

6/21/23, 12:26 - +91 89290 90206: I mean the free or trail plan is no more
6/21/23, 12:28 - +91 96600 03707: Yes yes i mean the basic plan where they take 10$ per month for the subscription
6/21/23, 12:28 - +91 89290 90206: Yes, 4 INR per image
6/21/23, 12:28 - +91 89290 90206: Selling at 10x the GPU cost
6/21/23, 12:36 - +91 96869 13429: Any one have the link or repo to build llm transformer based model from scratch on  the Conversational data
6/21/23, 13:06 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Yes the ai buzz with all the inertia built around chat gpt will maybe soon fade if we don‚Äôt apply to real life problems. I helped a team on Norwegians brainstorm business ideas and we settled on a Hugh hidden market of generating content to apply for European grants. They are working on it. I have been working on some other b2b stuff. But yes your remarks are very interesting.
6/21/23, 13:08 - +91 99712 24643: Will the generative AI space become bloated soon?
6/21/23, 13:15 - +91 89290 90206: It is there to stay for 3-4 years at least.
6/21/23, 13:16 - +91 99712 24643: 3-4 years is totally fine for a new tech
6/21/23, 13:16 - +91 98119 06112: Could you elaborate more on this
6/21/23, 13:16 - +91 90031 35354: Not really, people are getting very creative...
6/21/23, 13:18 - +91 98119 06112: Right now it's a buzz and when adaption happens on used cases it will become a way of doing things 
After 3 yrs alot of consolidation of players will start playing and mature models will come out
6/21/23, 13:19 - +91 98119 06112: AI is not just a buzz it's a transformative in many ways
6/21/23, 13:19 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Yes a classic gartner hype cycle.
6/21/23, 13:21 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Yes what do you want to know ?
6/21/23, 13:22 - +91 99712 24643: generative AI will feel natural at one point, it's just the hype will fade away.
6/21/23, 13:23 - +91 63695 89236: its different from your classic garnter cycle or boom bust cycle. its not like blockchain where the applications were difficult to implement. 
The applications are easy to create easy to implment and the results are immediate to be seen. 

add to that the speed of iteration of the underlying system/models is exponential. on top of that once we hit AGI sh*t is going to hit the fan. 

this will be a reason for massive disruption. 

personal example _ when i am programming or creating notes, content my personal time taken is reduced by 50% . this has massive impact on productivity across all verticals
6/21/23, 13:23 - +91 63695 89236: for people interested in geopolitical and economic perspective, i highly recommend this book:

As I said,
I had a gaming startup and a community of people across the ecosystem,

I used to do podcasts earlier, stopped due to certain reasons,
But I've miss the fun,

But who will listen to long podcasts now,
So, I'm looking to start with Twitter Spaces,

Also, I will love if @919891901981 could join me, 
I have a hosted more than 1k people online for an event, and the active rate was 70% until last.
Reply with a ‚ù§Ô∏è, who all interested.

Also, Folks interested, can look at our last year Showreel, you will have a Galla time... üçª.
6/21/23, 20:00 - +91 98919 01981: Anyone aware of open source libraries for image which is popular like Langchain ?

Any interesting use-cases you have built for images
6/21/23, 20:02 - +91 72474 89270: Image what?
6/21/23, 20:02 - +1 (416) 318-2921: I'm using stablediffusionapi.com
6/21/23, 20:02 - +91 75300 00751: Have you tried the Self Query Retriever in LangChain?
6/21/23, 20:06 - +91 98919 01981: open source libraries for developing on top of images
6/21/23, 20:07 - +91 84148 94286: I haven‚Äôt. But honestly my experience with langchain has not been so great. The large number of imports, retry errors,  the library trying to do a lot of things at the same time is a bit much. I think I am more productive using direct apis. 

Will check out self query retrieval though. Thanks
6/21/23, 20:07 - +91 75300 00751: Hmm interesting
6/21/23, 20:09 - +91 72474 89270: https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models
6/21/23, 20:09 - +91 72474 89270: If you are looking for models have a look at this
6/21/23, 20:10 - +91 98104 85533: could you explain this ? what additional layer is needed - we are building langchain adapters, so would love to know what you folks need and try to build (and opensource it).
6/21/23, 20:11 - +91 89290 90206: For images, I would not recommend you to use any open source library. Most of the open source models (finetuned SD models) are good at one thing, but fail miserably on another task.
6/21/23, 20:12 - +91 89290 90206: Prompt engineering is the best with base model of Stable Diffusion
6/21/23, 20:12 - +91 88103 86510: Have you tried ImageBind?
6/21/23, 20:12 - +91 89290 90206: We wasted weeks in trying out open source models at Gen VR. When most of the work could have been done by just adding an artist name
6/21/23, 20:13 - +91 88103 86510: You tried with rundiffusion, deliberate, Dreamshaper, revanimated? They generate excellent images in all categories
6/21/23, 20:13 - +91 98919 01981: Haven't tried, what does it do?
6/21/23, 20:13 - +91 89290 90206: Prompt engineering plus base SD is still better
6/21/23, 20:14 - +91 88103 86510: Multi-model by meta, basically it  understands images, text etc
6/21/23, 20:14 - +91 88103 86510: Many useful tools are build on top of it
6/21/23, 20:15 - +91 89290 90206: For research purposes, Deepfloyd IF
6/21/23, 20:15 - +91 89290 90206: is better
6/21/23, 20:15 - +91 88103 86510: Base sd requires complex prompts for giving good images, whereas other models give excellent images even with very basic description
6/21/23, 20:15 - +91 98919 01981: Will check it out thanks
6/21/23, 20:16 - +91 88103 86510: https://imagebind.metademolab.com/
6/21/23, 20:22 - +91 88103 86510: Honestly it's just overhyped
6/21/23, 20:23 - +91 88103 86510: Nothing will happen, this is common cycle. They will be asked to pay small fine which will be like pocket change to them and they will be off the hook. Happens in every industry regularly.
6/21/23, 20:24 - +91 88103 86510: SDXL images seem much better than midjourney to me. I am just waiting for it's release
6/21/23, 20:26 - +91 89290 90206: <Media omitted>
6/21/23, 20:27 - +91 89290 90206: <Media omitted>
6/21/23, 20:27 - +91 89290 90206: This should make it clear
6/21/23, 20:27 - +91 89290 90206: If changing base model is more important from SD to {Anything}
6/21/23, 20:27 - +91 89290 90206: or prompt engineering
6/21/23, 20:27 - +91 89290 90206: We have run these on 10,000 plus images
6/21/23, 20:27 - +91 89290 90206: All models you are mentioning
6/21/23, 20:33 - +91 72474 89270: What are this dreamshaper model fine tuned on?
6/21/23, 20:34 - +91 89290 90206: It is one of the best open sourced model finetuned on people images
6/21/23, 20:36 - +91 72474 89270: https://civitai.com/models/4384/dreamshaper
6/21/23, 20:36 - +91 72474 89270: Looks pretty good to me
6/21/23, 20:37 - +91 72474 89270: When a model is fine tuned, it can forget some concepts or become overly biased towards some domain of objects/art style
6/21/23, 20:39 - +91 73877 90163: They Are Earning More Than They Have To Pay
6/21/23, 20:39 - +91 73877 90163: ü´°
6/21/23, 20:39 - +91 88103 86510: this should make clear what? dreamshaper is a speciality model, its not trained to generate cartoon images. Obviously base model will give better output in that since its base model. But it comes nowhere near dreamshaper in dream styles. try comparing this with toonme model
6/21/23, 20:40 - +91 88103 86510: thats one of the reasons for different models. to generate really good images of specific styles/types. and in those areas base models come nowhere near
6/21/23, 20:41 - +91 88103 86510: actually its trained mainly on digital art, concept art, fantasy art these type
6/21/23, 20:44 - +91 72474 89270: I guess that is what mid journey does, it is more constrained to generate good images only
6/21/23, 20:44 - +91 72474 89270: Whereas base SD can generate a wide range of images
6/21/23, 20:44 - +91 88103 86510: actually it uses multiple models in backend
6/21/23, 20:45 - +91 73877 90163: Yup I Heard About That
6/21/23, 20:48 - +91 98919 01981: Also since it increases resolution for selected image, it has all the feedback from humans as to which generated image is good and then can do reinforcement learning
6/21/23, 20:48 - +91 89290 90206: Version 3 to version 4
6/21/23, 20:48 - +91 88103 86510: exactly, and it gets millions of feedback every day
6/21/23, 20:48 - +91 89290 90206: They did reinforcement learning
6/21/23, 20:49 - +91 89290 90206: Plus they did offset noise removal in diffusion
6/21/23, 20:49 - +91 89290 90206: Much before others
6/21/23, 20:49 - +91 89290 90206: Now, with millions in revenue
6/21/23, 20:49 - +91 89290 90206: They have trained a new base model of their own
6/21/23, 20:49 - +91 88103 86510: actually they were getting revenue thats why they were able to do
6/21/23, 20:50 - +91 89290 90206: So can't compare it with stable diffusion fine tuned models
6/21/23, 20:50 - +91 88103 86510: actually its very easy to train a base model, all the code and data is public, you just need money
6/21/23, 20:56 - +91 89290 90206: That's my point. That fine tuned models work well on one thing, but fail on another thing
6/21/23, 20:56 - +91 84148 94286: Basically, I meant the query gets transformed into different index query parameters. Both LLamaIndex auto-retrieval and LangChain Self-Retrieval are currently doing it by storing the metadata description of each vector index row. 

I meant a middle layer judging agent that can evaluate on these fetched semantically-matched nodes and formulate a response to the question that was originally asked. 

For instance, 

"Fetch last 10 quarters EPS values of Apple in tabular format"

Ideally, the middle-layer first formulates 10 queries according to the metadata description

ticker:"AAPL", quarter:"Q1", year:"2023". category: "EPS", Etc
 
But further more, it will expand upon it's own queries to cast a wider net. 

"AAPL", "Apple Inc", "EPS" -> "Earning per share"

And then after retrieving those, filters out duplicate, irrelevant & presents the documents in the user requestted format. 

LLamaIndex autoretrieval works great atleast in POC. It uses metadata descriptors. But an agent/library that can better fetch stored vector documents, will be most useful.
6/21/23, 20:56 - +91 89290 90206: Not like they can generate good images in all categories as you say
6/21/23, 20:57 - +91 88103 86510: Yes but they work way better on that one thing
6/21/23, 20:57 - +91 89290 90206: Not if you add a few prompts to base diffusion
6/21/23, 20:57 - +91 89290 90206: They still outperform
6/21/23, 20:58 - +91 89290 90206: But the advantage is greatly marginalized
6/21/23, 20:59 - +91 88103 86510: I would disagree
6/21/23, 20:59 - +91 88103 86510: base model has a very small influence of lots of styles, so it can and cant generate top tier images of many styles
6/21/23, 21:01 - +91 89290 90206: Try style to image for that
6/21/23, 21:01 - +91 89290 90206: Prompts plus style to image
6/21/23, 21:02 - +91 89290 90206: Is sufficient to compete with open source fine tuned models
6/21/23, 21:05 - +91 88103 86510: what if you dont have a image you want
6/21/23, 21:06 - +91 89290 90206: You generate it
6/21/23, 21:06 - +91 88103 86510: thats the point. the prompt has to be very good to get good images from base model
6/21/23, 21:08 - +91 89290 90206: https://diffusionart.co/google-say-new-styledrop-is-better-than-lora-dreambooth/
6/21/23, 21:08 - +91 88103 86510: yes but will they opensource it?
6/21/23, 21:09 - +91 89290 90206: Style 2 img
6/21/23, 21:09 - +91 88103 86510: google just showoffs tech and never releases it
6/21/23, 21:09 - +91 89290 90206: Is as good as their style drop
6/21/23, 21:09 - +91 89290 90206: That is controlnet based
6/21/23, 21:10 - +91 89290 90206: We at GenVR are bringing Style drop features in two weeks time
6/21/23, 21:11 - +91 88103 86510: there is t2iadapter that works really good
6/21/23, 21:11 - +91 89290 90206: Yes
6/21/23, 21:36 - +91 92072 82703: do i know you ?
6/21/23, 21:36 - +91 88103 86510: maybe. who knows.
6/21/23, 22:55 - +91 87505 01875: Hi @919971224643, Yes we are building things other than LLM & Gen AI. Sharing a link to my blogpost about what we did in last 1 year in field of AI.

6/22/23, 10:49 - +91 98919 01981: It's more like a Chatbase alternative
6/22/23, 11:04 - +91 94952 90550: Does it have any feature for internet access? I hope it just operates on weburl, pdf data sources isnt it? Are you aware of any chatgpt UI projects which takes in live web search context?
6/22/23, 11:04 - +91 63695 89236: Can langchain vector store return the similar results with score? Going thru the docs seems it's either or
6/22/23, 11:04 - +91 63695 89236: Good post
6/22/23, 11:05 - +91 98919 01981: You mean open-source ones ?
6/22/23, 11:05 - +91 98919 01981: I built MyGPT which has internet access but it is not open-source
6/22/23, 11:05 - +91 94952 90550: Yeah
6/22/23, 11:06 - +91 94952 90550: Interesting, how do u do web search? Any good api for that?
6/22/23, 11:06 - +91 98919 01981: I use duckduckgo api via client, it's free to use and works decent
6/22/23, 11:08 - +91 94952 90550: Cool
6/22/23, 11:18 - +91 90039 35733: You can also use SerpAPI, I guess
6/22/23, 11:20 - +91 86191 15677: SerpAPI is a very costly tho. I'd prefer duckduckgo api.
6/22/23, 11:21 - +91 86191 15677: Hey good folks - what are the best resources that you've found on finetuning? Can you please share some?

6/22/23, 12:50 - +91 99003 33006: Has anyone been using Azure Open AI?

Are the OpenAI functions available in Azure ?
6/22/23, 13:02 - +91 98246 36764: azure open ai is available for some regions only
6/22/23, 13:06 - +91 86191 15677: Haven't tried yet. But curious why are you using azure?

Is it because of their privacy policies?
6/22/23, 13:07 - +91 98246 36764: no because they are fast in getting response and overload server error comes less than standard open ai api
6/22/23, 13:12 - +91 81471 44586: We are using azure openai, they have only 0301 version available as of now. no updates on 0613.

6/22/23, 13:13 - +91 90052 36891: Azure openai ChatGPT service
6/22/23, 13:15 - +91 86191 15677: Oh, I didn't know that. Could you please point me to a benchmarking document or any other resource (if you have any handy) where I can see the latency comparison between Azure and making direct OpenAI calls?

6/22/23, 22:57 - +91 99105 48139: Great talk to you guys tomorrow ü§ü
6/22/23, 22:57 - +44 7404 656243: that is a good idea - may be we can have a round the room intros and go from there
6/22/23, 22:58 - +91 88103 86510: yes that will be excellent
6/22/23, 22:58 - +91 75887 58559: Yup

6/22/23, 23:13 - +91 84387 68286: Hey guys, am Heerthi. Just now started learning AI especially ML, DL, CV, NLP. I have some ideas to implement. Am a beginner though. I want guidance for that.

I bit specialised in CV. I have a idea in fitness + AI. Can anyone help me to grow my idea from development to deployment.

Your thoughts?
6/23/23, 09:20 - +1 (804) 774-8169: Only if the data scientist isn't using AI üòÇ
6/23/23, 09:20 - +91 88103 86510: This is very short-sighted thinking. You should study more about the actual widespread impacts of AI on our society as whole

6/23/23, 09:21 - +91 88103 86510: Machine can already understand it
6/23/23, 09:21 - +91 84387 68286: Just now read an article in kdnuggets. That's why I asked here.
6/23/23, 09:22 - +91 84387 68286: Yes of course.
6/23/23, 09:22 - +91 88103 86510: We just don't have enough compute currently
6/23/23, 09:22 - +91 88103 86510: People always say ai can't do x because of reason y. But the proof is there, you can see the progress in just 1 year yourself.
6/23/23, 09:23 - +91 84387 68286: I read it already!

6/23/23, 09:24 - +91 88103 86510: Gpt4 can generalize to a variety of new problems within a few shots without any additional fine-tuning.
6/23/23, 09:26 - +91 84387 68286: Yes. To think rationally. We want to hear the words of both side
6/23/23, 09:26 - +91 88103 86510: And this is just the beginning, with the amount of research and optimisations in this year alone, gpt5 can be made atleast 2-3 more powerful in same cost. Then there is sensory understanding for LLMs like vision, depth, audio etc. See ImageBind and imagine how much progress we will see once it gets added to something like gpt4

6/23/23, 09:27 - +91 88103 86510: Short-sighted. Change is much beyond what you can imagine
6/23/23, 09:27 - +91 88103 86510: "yet"
6/23/23, 09:27 - +91 79790 79505: Change is the fundamental law of nature
6/23/23, 09:27 - +91 88103 86510: Exactly. And humans are worse at predicting change
6/23/23, 09:28 - +91 93530 83597: Ai is begining not that much evolved you will see in movie 
Robot chiti and all
6/23/23, 09:28 - +91 88103 86510: Because our minds didn't evolve to predict
6/23/23, 09:28 - +91 88103 86510: üëçüëç nvm
6/23/23, 09:28 - +91 79790 79505: We are only species to have understood the value of change, evolution states that. Our existence uptil now, is the sole reason because of change
6/23/23, 09:29 - +91 88103 86510: It evolved to adapt. But in today's society people are so afraid and resisting of change and don't want to see beyond the short vision
6/23/23, 09:29 - +91 88103 86510: We are the only specifies "we know for now".
6/23/23, 09:29 - +91 88103 86510: Species*
6/23/23, 09:29 - +91 79790 79505: That's polarization,

6/23/23, 09:32 - +91 79790 79505: I understand where you are coming from, but it's the same company that made viruses to sell anti-virus...
6/23/23, 09:32 - +91 88103 86510: They don't have to, there's no lack of people who want to make viruses. Don't trust random things you read in news and articles
6/23/23, 09:33 - +91 79790 79505: Exactly, what I was telling you.
6/23/23, 09:33 - +91 88103 86510: When ?
6/23/23, 09:35 - +91 79790 79505: Look for it, you will understand.

Also, it seems you are not willing to change, but I'm, would love to understand your thoughts.

Since change..... Yk.
6/23/23, 09:39 - +91 88103 86510: Oh nice
6/23/23, 09:39 - +91 88103 86510: Nvm
6/23/23, 09:44 - +91 79790 79505: This was an interesting point,
But I just want you to rethink and look, 

Our Brains haven't evolved.
But we are more predictive than ever before.

The reason we don't enjoy movies with similar stories because we can predict.

The thing which excess info has done is that it has fetch our minds with loads of data, which makes it think we know it.

Neither me, nor you, know anything, but we both can predict very well, and this comes from our expirience and insights.
6/23/23, 09:51 - +91 84387 68286: https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/airbnb-ceo-predicts-ai-will-pave-the-way-for-millions-of-startups-instead-of-replacing-jobs/articleshow/101118613.cms
6/23/23, 09:55 - +91 88103 86510: We can not predict, we can only identify patterns. And we do that because it allows us to optimise
6/23/23, 09:56 - +91 88103 86510: In very short term,maybe. Over the span of 10-20 years... No one can tell
6/23/23, 09:57 - +91 79790 79505: The outcome that comes after identifying patterns is called Prediction.
6/23/23, 09:58 - +91 88103 86510: Ok
6/23/23, 09:58 - +91 88103 86510: Real life doesn't go in patterns
6/23/23, 09:59 - +91 79790 79505: Whatever it is, whoever is right wrong nothing matters, at the end, it's all about existence
6/23/23, 09:59 - +91 88103 86510: Else everyone will be predicting things and enjoying life
6/23/23, 09:59 - +91 83697 55952: Its in a primitive stage. Machines still fail when it comes to mathematics. There is an area dedicated to automated theorem proving lies at the intersection of logic, mathematics and computers. Existing "AI" is still a statistical model and may take some time to reach there or may not even reach, because mathematical proofs can't simply be created and takes human ingenuity in extreme cases. They will catch up with beginner math and college level but to become a "Mathematician" may take some time or we are in the wrong direction
6/23/23, 09:59 - +91 79790 79505: That's why it's called Prediction and not Reality.

It's just a perception.
6/23/23, 10:00 - +91 88103 86510: Prediction != Perception
6/23/23, 10:01 - +91 88103 86510: Prediction is somewhat accurate forecast of what will happen. Perception is a view on any situation. They are totally different things.
6/23/23, 10:02 - +91 83697 55952: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03393.pdf
6/23/23, 10:02 - +91 79790 79505: Correct, I mean from an overall narrative basis. Since, we tend to avoid most nuances.
6/23/23, 10:02 - +91 88103 86510: Not from any basis. Those are different things.
6/23/23, 10:04 - +91 79790 79505: That's a perception.
6/23/23, 10:04 - +91 88103 86510: No, that's a fact
6/23/23, 10:04 - +91 79790 79505: Anyways, let's take it over call someday, text can't justify most nuances.
6/23/23, 10:05 - +91 88103 86510: Text is more suitable for calm discussions. Calls turn into full blown screaming arguments very quickly. Text gives time to think carefully before replying
6/23/23, 10:07 - +91 79790 79505: I feel there's something that had a very bad impact on you.
6/23/23, 10:14 - +91 88103 86510: Nope, it's just a tendency of people. They seem to begin screaming and getting personal in arguments when they can't give proper counter-arguments.
6/23/23, 10:16 - +91 79790 79505: Well, eventually you can't just talk to bots to avoid people and their tendencies.

Nothing more to say.
6/23/23, 10:17 - +91 88103 86510: Not yet, but very soon. Today's bots have better logic than atleast 70-80% of people
6/23/23, 10:17 - +91 88103 86510: And they are much more empathic

I am in my 3rd year of Engineering and actively looking for Internship, My field of interest is AI and Data Science as I am from same Engineering field.
If anyone can help me for finding internship will really appreciated.
6/23/23, 12:01 - +91 98919 01981: Which vector db is everyone using in production
6/23/23, 12:01 - +919156212345: I'm using ChromaDB
6/23/23, 12:01 - +91 76820 77931: Pinecone or chromadb
6/23/23, 12:01 - +91 63695 89236: Was using pinecone before but shifted to Supabase. Quote happy with js. Supabase python not so much
6/23/23, 12:02 - +91 98919 01981: Chromadb works for local but for production would need something to store state
6/23/23, 12:02 - +91 98919 01981: I am using pinecone for one of my projects currently in testing state
6/23/23, 12:02 - +91 63695 89236: Just go for Supabase it works well with langchain
6/23/23, 12:03 - +91 70773 54197: Pinecone or open source ones like Qdrant or Deeplake?
6/23/23, 12:03 - +91 63695 89236: Pinecone doesn't have good ui to view the texts.
6/23/23, 12:03 - +91 98919 01981: But heard some bad things about pinecone as they don't allow exporting the data
6/23/23, 12:03 - +91 70773 54197: Yeah this is also good one
6/23/23, 12:03 - +91 63695 89236: Supabase filtering is also powerful
6/23/23, 12:03 - +91 98919 01981: How is the speed compared to pinecone
6/23/23, 12:04 - +91 63695 89236: No difference
6/23/23, 12:04 - +91 63695 89236: Fast
6/23/23, 12:04 - +91 70773 54197: Yeah. Sometimes the Environment name also doesn't work üòï
6/23/23, 12:04 - +91 63695 89236: Learning curve is also low. Took me 30m to switch over hah
6/23/23, 12:04 - +91 98919 01981: That was one major factor to prefer a pure vector db
6/23/23, 12:05 - +91 98919 01981: But if supabase works well I might shift
6/23/23, 12:06 - +91 98104 85533: depends on where u are deploying. the answer to this question is always related to cost vs compliance.
if u already have a postgres database backend, supabase+pgvector is cost efficient.
if u have massive scale, elasticsearch dense vectors
if ur on nosql, then redis will work (and pass security compliance in india)
for all the above, there are decades of self-deployment knowledge already built in.

for all other usecases, there is the rest. fairly similar in cost and usecases. and deployment complexity if u want to self-deploy. there arent many devops who will be familiar on scaling them (if u self host)
6/23/23, 12:07 - +91 98919 01981: Compliance is not an issue for me. And I don't have a massive scale. So supabase looks like the best option for now
6/23/23, 12:11 - +91 98104 85533: works very well if u already a PG installation. just double check if ur hosted db allows the pgvector installation. AWS has been iffy to include this in newer versions on RDS.
otherwise all good
6/23/23, 12:12 - +91 98919 01981: Currently using aws rds with postgres
6/23/23, 12:12 - +91 98919 01981: Will check regarding pg vector

6/23/23, 12:12 - +91 98104 85533: they just released support. like literally 2 weeks back. but depends on ur RDS version
6/23/23, 12:12 - +91 63695 89236: Pinecone is inferior in my experience
6/23/23, 12:13 - +91 63695 89236: Limited *
6/23/23, 12:14 - +91 98919 01981: Thanks for sharing will check it our
6/23/23, 12:26 - +91 63695 89236: Anyone tried contextual compression retriever from langchain? i tried but its not so good. my use case is filtering the right context before passing to llm. i believe its a common use case

6/23/23, 15:33 - +91 88103 86510: There are already so many good opensource vector db, don't use the proprietary ones as they don't give any advantage and may cause vendor lock-in
6/23/23, 15:35 - +91 98919 01981: but self hosting and scaling is a problem
6/23/23, 15:40 - +91 90031 35354: What the hell, how can they do that üòî
6/23/23, 15:43 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): They took scary amt of time to resolve it, as well. ü•≤ü•≤
6/23/23, 15:45 - +91 96877 95488: Why are they doing this? Also they don't want to lose users.

6/23/23, 16:38 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Untill there is a way to self host vector db , my projects will not be production ready. In eu I need to justify where I store the data and what I do with it . with services like pinecone it‚Äôs never sure.
6/23/23, 16:47 - +91 75300 00751: U can try supabase they support vectors in Postgres
6/23/23, 16:48 - +91 75300 00751: Or self host chroma

6/23/23, 18:34 - +91 84387 68286: Building an AI applications will be one of the most crucial skills for the next 20 years. üî•

If I were starting today, I'd learn these:

‚Ä¢ Python
‚Ä¢ OpenAI API
‚Ä¢ Langchain
6/23/23, 18:40 - +91 90031 35354: AI apps are over hyped bro, in my humble opinion. There are many applications that are solid without much hype around it.
6/23/23, 18:40 - +91 84387 68286: Yes. I agree!
6/23/23, 18:41 - +91 90031 35354: Great to have this TechStack but saying for next 20 years is just hype. 

AI apps hype will die down in 2 years and real winners will be the ones those who targetted the right usecases and right users üòÄ
6/23/23, 18:42 - +91 84387 68286: Like a .com bubble. Many websites came then. But some real winners sustained in the market till now.

6/23/23, 18:44 - +91 90031 35354: Supermeme.ai
6/23/23, 18:44 - +91 90031 35354: This uses AI to create memes
6/23/23, 18:45 - +91 90031 35354: This will sustain for a long time beyond the GenAI wave üåä

Why ?

They generate images for memes, but there is a strong usecase of people wanting to create new memes with their own words or thoughts üíØ

6/23/23, 18:53 - +91 70248 80719: What do you all think about quantum machine learning?

Is it promising enough for future or just another baseless media hype?
6/23/23, 18:54 - +91 90031 35354: Quantum ML is good for future.

Good to Have it in your TechStack

6/23/23, 18:54 - +91 88103 86510: Never trust media for anything. Think for yourself. What actually is quantum machine learning? Have you seen any real impact of it? Only future will tell
6/23/23, 18:54 - +91 79790 79505: It's my Take,
You Guys can comment.

I feel information is dead now, authenticity will sell. That's what all the profile checks subscription are for. Authenticity.

So, I feel Bigger Brands will Kill most startups, they said are gonna grow, but eventually they will acquire or crush, with the Brand Name.

6/23/23, 18:55 - +91 90031 35354: But for now, it's more of research based and we've not reached the level of using Quantum ML at the moment, but it's coming in near future
6/23/23, 18:56 - +91 79790 79505: Google and IBM, when they reach 100quibits, bigger than anything
6/23/23, 18:56 - +91 90031 35354: That's the strategy big companies are using for a longtime, but rather they should acquire the startups and grow them as well, so that you can be both a MNC & Start-up combined üòÄ
6/23/23, 18:59 - +91 80560 03152: I think there are two ways to test if your AI app will sustain beyond the wave..

1. Your app solves an use case which was previously not possible without AI.

2. Your app still solves a customer need even without AI, just that with AI you solve it better. 

This is of course over simplified, but helps you to check if you are riding the wave or solving something real.

6/24/23, 10:54 - +91 88103 86510: Who else do you think filters 10k+ resumes
6/24/23, 11:05 - +91 84387 68286: Yeah bruh. Our resumes too filtered in many companies. I know that. But the idea of him is fully process. Like interview, gd and what are the process involved in recruiting want to be managed by his AI assistant. That's his idea.
6/24/23, 11:25 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): How can one collect crucial user data from user interactions with your gpt bot?
Like is there a mechanism to do so? 
Lets say User is interacting with a simple GPT bot, I want to store all data whenever user mentions anything related his personal info like his name, profession, interests, objectives etc
Type of data stored could be different but i want to know how can i save only required datapoints from the user conversation. 

I feel i can do it using function calling but i see too many pitfalls in this approach.
Any better ideas?
6/24/23, 11:28 - +91 72474 89270: Try tagging
6/24/23, 11:28 - +91 72474 89270: <Media omitted>
6/24/23, 11:28 - +91 90215 66239: You can collect logs from the interactions on fields like question, response, feedback given, token used etc
6/24/23, 11:28 - +91 72474 89270: Check the last slide
6/24/23, 11:29 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Yes but the usecase is realtime
6/24/23, 11:29 - +91 90215 66239: Yes, I am doing the exact same thing for real time monitoring
6/24/23, 11:30 - +91 90215 66239: These logs are exported and parsed by the monitoring tool
6/24/23, 11:32 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Ok, so if you can process logs to get the Info, then why not parse the user input directly to extract the data? Like what is the advantage of this approach?
6/24/23, 11:35 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): This is promising but as I mentioned pitfalls with function calling . It's not yet suitable for production as there's a a massive increase in token consumption.

6/24/23, 11:40 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Ok, can you elaborate on how you are processing the logs to extract user data?
6/24/23, 11:52 - +91 72474 89270: You have to do the same even with langchain tools + it is not very efficient
6/24/23, 11:53 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Right
6/24/23, 11:53 - +91 72474 89270: If you just want to convert logs to JSON, it can be done with prompt engineering + some parsing voodoo
6/24/23, 11:54 - +91 72474 89270: Json output from gpt is not always perfect but works 90% of the times if you have good enough parsing function
6/24/23, 11:56 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): That is not actually the usecase ,but as an alternative I could use it to parse user input and retrieve info.
6/24/23, 11:56 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Seems we'll have to work with function calling at this stage
6/24/23, 12:04 - +91 72474 89270: I have some rough idea of how to do this with prompt engineering, will try in the night and share
6/24/23, 12:06 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): I'm exploring with langchain + function calling.

6/24/23, 18:07 - +1 (434) 505-5420: Prompt chaining + No-code chatbot builders can do this. 

We at Chatveda, have been working on a system where we can build AI chatbots using prompt engineering and traditional no-code chatbot building. 

Happy to show you a demo on how it works and an account to experiment with it!
6/24/23, 18:08 - +91 63695 89236: this is very easy. save it in firestore. get the conversation and summarize it before resending as context
6/24/23, 18:47 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Will check
6/24/23, 18:47 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): If you're able to do it via prompt Engineering then that'll be a catch. 
My usecase is small, so I'm giving it a shot myself using agent tagging. 
If not we'll setup a meet. ü§ûüèº
6/24/23, 18:51 - +1 (434) 505-5420: Yes sure!

6/24/23, 22:25 - +91 99028 78869: Because it's the best tool available in its domain.
6/24/23, 22:27 - +1 (416) 318-2921: Random - I've been getting ingestion errors with Pinecone recently.

I've found that by ingesting the bodies of knowledge in smaller pieces I.e. 5-10 docs at a send is an easy workaround.

That said I can tell y'all geniuses don't have the same problems I do! ü§£ü§£ü§£
6/24/23, 22:36 - +91 98919 01981: You can also store the document data separate and only the vector data in pinecone

6/25/23, 15:41 - +91 88103 86510: lmsys leaderboard is a joke. they will always show vicuna at top when its nowhere near other opensource competitors, and they will never add other opensource models because they are way better than vicuna
6/25/23, 15:42 - +91 88103 86510: https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard this leaderboard is much more accurate
6/25/23, 15:42 - +91 99105 48139: Might be
6/25/23, 15:43 - +91 88103 86510: you can simply chat with vicuna and see its quality yourself.
6/25/23, 15:44 - +91 99105 48139: It would have been nice if HF can also add gpt4/3, claud models which are industry's benchmark.
6/25/23, 15:45 - +91 88103 86510: its crystal clear, currently no opensource model reaches near gpt4 or cloude+ except in some narrow tasks
6/25/23, 15:45 - +91 88103 86510: also hf one is focused on opensource llms
6/25/23, 15:46 - +91 88103 86510: and reaching quality of gpt 3.5/cloude instant is a bit more clouded. some LLMs seem to outperform those but still they cant be said to surpass it clearly
6/25/23, 16:09 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Yes I started working on this a month back. My audience is French speaking so I did this in French but the idea is the same. Looking at the twitter post, the user experience is not streamlined. You need access to external tools like ahref or Semrush to identify the keywords. But by plugging in google search console and Adsense the data is more qualitative. Dm me if you want to collaborate.
6/25/23, 16:12 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: If some of you guys want to work on it let me know. This is a gold mine. I see opportunity not in gen ai but rather on building a erp system by itself based on user needs and ai. Dm if interested <This message was edited>

 I think you  shouldn't be worried there are similar products, why? With a good launch strategy you can do similar product with a different narrative..
Already when they launched their product I already know several products that do the same, but here their launch strategy, created enough hype(influencers, affiliate program)...the best would the earliest market entry.
 Yes uniqueness is good for a competitive edge but it should not come at cost  of delaying market entry..and you would be adding features incrementally

My temperature is 0 since I don't want model to hallucinate and simply adding to prompt like "respond friendly" won't actually work right, to my understanding having a personality mean there should be a difference in the temperature settings too right? Is my thinking right, or simple prompt engineering would do like few shot prompting.
6/26/23, 05:11 - +1 (780) 237-2506: Having a personality will always deal with a level of randomness so hallucinations are going to happen. Only have 0 temperature for strickly math.

Sorry bro - but if you want it to have a personality you gotta risk hallucinations
6/26/23, 05:12 - +1 (862) 754-4963: Understood, thank you

6/26/23, 18:05 - +91 97246 54616: Genuinely, next Infosys for AI would be big step backwards. Yes, we need OpenAI, Anthropic kind of stuff not Infosys, TCS. 

Obsession with IT services has already played big role in not having great global tech product here. üòä
6/26/23, 18:09 - +91 7397 360 520: I would very happy and fine if I have a really high quality service based company of my own. :)
6/26/23, 18:09 - +91 80560 03152: It‚Äôs a good point, we must aim higher and build models, at the same time, we must capitalise on the lead we have got in services.

AI transformation is going to lead many enterprises to deploy on prem AI solutions, so if Indians firms can build great products and also combine with our services expertise, will be perfect! <This message was edited>
6/26/23, 18:10 - +91 90031 35354: Problem with Developing a product in India is its customers wanting cheap and best products.

There is nothing called Cheap AND Best, there can only be Cheap or Best.

The whole ecosystem doesn't support Product based companies in India to attain Profits.
6/26/23, 18:10 - +91 63897 32939: Litterly
6/26/23, 18:11 - +91 63897 32939: Even in service based company also
6/26/23, 18:19 - +91 97246 54616: Got your point. 

Fundamental advancement & control of AI is going to define position of any nation now on. So it's not just any IT or software thing. It's matter of national interest.

6/26/23, 18:30 - +91 97246 54616: Birth & explosion of Google, Facebook, Youtube, WhatsApp even OpenAI etc. was not driven by purchasing ability & drive of Americans.
6/26/23, 18:50 - +91 98216 85099: Example of jio in India
You give things free initially and once they get habituated start charging for the value people derive from the product.
6/26/23, 19:07 - +91 72474 89270: I don't think that's an Indian problem, while freelancing I experienced this issue from clients all over the world
6/26/23, 19:08 - +91 72474 89270: It is just how you position your product and target your audience
6/26/23, 19:08 - +91 63897 32939: It's true product like Google, Facebook, Youtube, WhatsApp even OpenAl etc. was not driven by purchasing ability,  But it's also true that only alone americans spend around 30 percent of global R&D around 700 billion dollar including on product as you mention product like,Google, youtube,open AI....
6/26/23, 19:10 - +91 90031 35354: JIO is how products should launch and continue üíØ

2) Disrupt the whole market to bring down prices ü•≥
6/26/23, 19:15 - +91 90031 35354: So that R&D Spend is the ecosystem we cannot get in India sadly - that's the ecosystem  i was talking about üòî
6/26/23, 19:33 - +91 63897 32939: Yeah bro, R&D investment is far away, yaha to daily use hone wale road ke constructione me bhi lowest bid dekhte hai atleast budget ka 90percent hi laga dete üòî

I have recently seen tool such as AutoML / AutoWeka.. 

Is there really a way to automate machine learning algorithms?
6/26/23, 19:36 - +91 92050 66063: Don't forget the killing the competition part
6/26/23, 19:36 - +91 63897 32939: Yeah right but Every one i think almost no one can afford this level of Freemium, second main reason is that it has very low competition just 3 4 player and chances of new coming are almost zero.                                        You also known jiomart B2B is also part of jio who has started in early giving big discount, coupoun what a mad within 1500 order you get 200 cashback while it's just of 10 percent margain business,  to compete with udan and many early stage startup in this field like Superzop...etc.                       But this freemium system jiomart b2b game has flopped, why bcz this segment is very lucrative and very competitive not like telecom sector, market Every region you get APMC and mandi.           And now jiomart b2b is shrunk almost they even now don't offer sugar to customer and fired to many employees
6/26/23, 19:38 - +91 63897 32939: If you see same in ride hailing, driver just use ola to acquired customer, same as oyo if you go ,they will provide their own card and say you will get in low Price if directly come
6/26/23, 19:38 - +91 63897 32939: Same as in urban company
6/26/23, 19:39 - +91 90031 35354: They can keep the Top Rank but they've killed other companies fully

6/26/23, 19:39 - +91 90031 35354: Airtel is fighting head to head but it's quality is not as good as JIO
6/26/23, 19:43 - +91 90031 35354: When JIO has both good quality & low price, it can stay on top for a longtime, unlike Airtel which lacked both in the first place, Airtel and other companies used to charge 300 per 1 GB data - remember those days before JIO üòÇ
6/26/23, 19:53 - +91 72474 89270: While companies like JIO Facebook are good examples of monopolies and economics of scale, there is a lot of space for niche start-ups which have focus at problem solving or value creation
6/26/23, 19:54 - +91 72474 89270: Simple rule to run a SaaS service is to target people who are already making money and help them do it efficiently

6/27/23, 15:02 - +91 99003 33006: Does anyone know how to get the tokens consumed in AzureOpenAI?

I am trying to check token consumption by caching in LangChain
6/27/23, 18:17 - +91 98919 01981: I believe this should help since you are using Langchain

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms/how_to/token_usage_tracking
6/27/23, 18:25 - +91 99003 33006: Checked this 
This works only if the LLM you instantiate is a OpenAi one and not Azure version of it
6/27/23, 18:28 - +91 99003 33006: And also surprisingly the caching is not working if we use Azure Open AI

llm = AzureChatOpenAI(‚Ä¶.)
If I use this llm and do a llm.predict() after giving it a cache memory
6/27/23, 18:30 - +91 98919 01981: It might be possible these are not supported for non-openai models
6/27/23, 18:30 - +91 98919 01981: You might have to do some custom code and raise a pull request
6/27/23, 18:30 - +91 99003 33006: But azure open ai is just an extended version right?üòÖ
6/27/23, 18:31 - +91 99003 33006: I hope LangChain supports AzureOpenAI caching soon

6/28/23, 05:52 - +61 451 126 325: I have used this, but I find that it is too slow only regular consumer hardware for it to be useful yet
6/28/23, 05:52 - +61 451 126 325: On*
6/28/23, 05:53 - +61 451 126 325: 8 core 16GB of RAM

6/28/23, 08:31 - +91 99104 97852: It has GPT4All model.. It‚Äôs good.. But not useful for bigger documents..
6/28/23, 08:32 - +91 99104 97852: Stores embedding locally .. using chroma
6/28/23, 08:38 - +91 96181 27848: Someone asked about hackathon: https://soonami.io/hackathon
6/28/23, 09:57 - +91 98919 01981: Yeah but many are interested regarding using for private data. So wanted to check how people are using it
6/28/23, 09:59 - +91 72474 89270: Tried a few quantised models on M2 air 16GB ram
6/28/23, 09:59 - +91 72474 89270: Gpt4all gives a very easy installation experience
6/28/23, 10:00 - +91 72474 89270: I was surprised that it can even work on air
6/28/23, 10:03 - +91 72474 89270: But since opensource models are already behind ChatGPT, and you'll be using smaller and quantised models which makes it even worse
6/28/23, 10:03 - +91 98919 01981: Yeah the response is not comparable to ChatGPT yet
6/28/23, 10:04 - +91 72474 89270: I guess hosting your own model would be worth it
6/28/23, 10:04 - +91 98919 01981: Only usecase I see is if your data is private and don't want to share with OpenAI
6/28/23, 10:07 - +61 451 126 325: I tried it out for the same reason..but may be we are not ready yet
6/28/23, 10:20 - +91 72474 89270: Has anyone tried running a bigger model in the cloud?
6/28/23, 10:20 - +91 72474 89270: Looking at the benchmarks I feel there are a lot of use cases that open source models can solve
6/28/23, 12:10 - +91 63695 89236: Damn cool

6/28/23, 14:30 - +49 176 68405700: Hello everyone doing masters in Germany University is good?
6/28/23, 14:30 - +49 176 68405700: The spreciality is health and medical data analytics
6/28/23, 14:31 - +49 176 68405700: Or not?
6/28/23, 14:32 - +91 63695 89236: subjective question. 
heres my two cents. 

Where you do masters will be a big factor in where you find your job and maybe even settle down. 

unless you are really going just to study and come back = depends on the university

if you are going for job prospects you must look at the socioeconomic situation of the country

to get a job in germany you need ot learn the language . german is a pain ass language (my friend did masters and is living ther enow)

unfortunately the question is out of scope for this group
6/28/23, 14:32 - +44 7404 656243: My personal take is it will be as good as you make it - its all in your hands Vignesh üòÄ
6/28/23, 14:32 - +91 63695 89236: also the outlook for europe is not very good for the future (lot of illegal migration and crimes are rising). you can get a equaly paying job in india and live a better quality of life in india
6/28/23, 14:33 - +49 176 68405700: Ok danke sch√∂n üëç
6/28/23, 14:33 - +49 176 68405700: Danke Bitte
6/28/23, 14:34 - +44 7447 450227: Depends on a lot of personal factors but in general:
Look into the professors and the track record of the university. Also, some of it depends on your german proficiency.
If you are not paying a lot and are young, doing a masters almost anywhere abroad is worth it! It will give you immense exposure and improve your connections in the industry
6/28/23, 14:35 - +49 176 68405700: Yes I'm doing in erlangen (Friedrich Alexander universitat Erlangen Nuremberg)
6/28/23, 14:41 - +44 7447 450227: Not a bad choice at all, best of luck vignesh! 
Although, I would again like to stress it. You are not going to learn anything magical there. What you are going there is to build useful connections, a deeper understanding of the market and the research happening, and a new experience in life. Language can be a problem and would highly stress learning some level of conversational german. Just be outgoing and it will be an amazingand fruitful journey for sure
6/28/23, 14:42 - +49 176 68405700: Yes now I'm going through A2 german
6/28/23, 14:43 - +44 7404 656243: @447447450227 you in UK ? dm me
6/28/23, 15:09 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: I believe ideas alone have no value, so I am sharing my idea here. I have tested the market and there is need for such application. If anyone wants to collaborate on this please dm me. My idea is to make this open source. Idea : using generative ai, help illiterates or people with language challenges to construct sentences to write an email. This will make people inclusive in the society. Example : ¬´¬†can us cme two youre homes tomorow.¬†Let me no.¬†¬ª is changed to ¬´¬†can we come to your home tomorrow. Let me know¬†¬ª dm me if you want to contribute. I will start a git project

6/29/23, 12:24 - +91 63695 89236: HI community, anyone has suggestion deployment options langchain application on nodejs backend
6/29/23, 12:24 - +91 63695 89236: considering netlify: any concerns. wanted to avoid aws
6/29/23, 12:26 - +91 63695 89236: my only concern is sometimes the openai llm takes 60-120 sec to respond./complete the stream
6/29/23, 12:26 - +44 7404 656243: I would recommend something like fast api and host it on render.com would recommend langchain py over js
Netlify has cold start issues (atleast I got annoyed)
6/29/23, 12:27 - +91 63695 89236: thanks but its too late to rewrite. anyway its mvp so i am vcalidating the idea
6/29/23, 12:27 - +91 63695 89236: i considered pythong at beggining to but for speed i chose js (my own limitation)
6/29/23, 12:27 - +91 63695 89236: cold start = even on paid plan?
6/29/23, 12:30 - +91 72474 89270: Yeah cold start is a problem with serverless functions in general
6/29/23, 12:30 - +91 72474 89270: Premium can slightly increase the speed
6/29/23, 12:30 - +91 72474 89270: But the problem will persist
6/29/23, 12:33 - +91 63695 89236: how about edge functions
6/29/23, 12:39 - +91 72474 89270: They are also serverless functions
6/29/23, 12:40 - +91 63695 89236: i see
6/29/23, 12:40 - +91 63695 89236: so the solution to the problem is hosting express server on aws?
6/29/23, 12:43 - +91 72474 89270: Yes
6/29/23, 12:43 - +91 63695 89236: noted thanks
6/29/23, 12:47 - +91 70757 99736: if its 120 seconds, is it async work or is there a connection between client and server for that long?
6/29/23, 12:48 - +91 63695 89236: if i use streaming, connection is long. if no streaming, openai api takes ~ 60 secs
6/29/23, 12:48 - +91 63695 89236: because my context is long
6/29/23, 12:48 - +91 63695 89236: its 60 seconds actually. 120 happened only once so that snot normal
6/29/23, 12:49 - +91 70757 99736: so just edge functions
no cold boots
6/29/23, 12:49 - +91 63695 89236: yeah
6/29/23, 12:49 - +91 63695 89236: https://render.com/docs/deploy-nextjs-app
i guess render or heroku will also avoid the cold start problem right
6/29/23, 13:03 - +44 7404 656243: Yes that's right these are server full not serverless same for digital ocean droplet or ec2 etc..
6/29/23, 13:13 - +91 63695 89236: noted. thanks
6/29/23, 13:29 - +91 75887 58559: Can anyone tell me how to can we create digital human
6/29/23, 13:37 - +91 75868 37471: How do you define digital human?
6/29/23, 14:11 - +91 83697 55952: we are not able to create even digital work forget about digital human

6/29/23, 14:19 - +27 82 775 8235: Interesring comment
I was thinking something similair the other day 

Everybody jumping on the hype of AI

But can you really move to AI without having Digitally transformed your organisation or work environement/processes etc
6/29/23, 14:20 - +91 84387 68286: Yes
6/29/23, 14:21 - +44 7404 656243: organisations who do not transform might perish unless they have enough cash to burn or a government to bail them out üòú
6/29/23, 14:23 - +91 72474 89270: The government is not bailing anyone, so only one way out
6/29/23, 14:23 - +44 7404 656243: not talking about Indian govt lol
6/29/23, 14:24 - +44 7404 656243: above comment is in a good spirit btw üëÜ
6/29/23, 14:24 - +44 7404 656243: I just dont like govt bailing out large cos who have made blunders
6/29/23, 14:25 - +44 7404 656243: the us debt crisis is massive and it just keeps mounting
6/29/23, 14:25 - +91 72474 89270: Same here, it's just corruption in the day light
6/29/23, 14:26 - +91 72474 89270: Tax payers paying for mistake of these corps
6/29/23, 14:33 - +91 63695 89236: You're right the problem is not technology availability, it's the the implementation /real world application
6/29/23, 14:34 - +91 97246 54616: When I hear about word "AI Hype"; this come to mind :

1. It's creating real value, yes some field require more maturity & adjustments for adoption but value creation & usage is real thing.

More importantly, 
2. Advancing AI is natural path of evolution of intelligence. As our evolution has made our world & challenges more and more complex, we require equal level of height in intelligence to keep up with it. It's extremely important to achieve abundance of Intelligence to move current world forward in better way.

6/30/23, 13:50 - +91 72474 89270: 3D looking image or you want the whole STL file?
6/30/23, 13:50 - +91 70456 63873: stl file
6/30/23, 13:50 - +91 70456 63873: 3d looking image as option also works with me

6/30/23, 14:14 - +44 7404 656243: @917045663873 @917247489270 what might work is to get a depth map and ingest it in blender. I tried this a little while ago but because I am not an expert in blender I could not do it property. But sharing my progress here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K1SHEANVMNTTtj77fqwaEqAWN3QloXj-?usp=sharing

If anyone can help me with blender it would be highly appreciated
6/30/23, 14:16 - +91 72474 89270: What prompt and model did you use for generating this image?
6/30/23, 14:16 - +91 72474 89270: I don't want a 3D model, just this style
6/30/23, 14:17 - +44 7404 656243: Ah I see. This rocket image is just a royalty free one
6/30/23, 14:18 - +44 7404 656243: So what you could do is gather a bunch of representative 3d style images and train your stable diffusion

The model performs well, but sometimes it references it to the document. For example, Based on the document I found this . . . ., I don't want the model to reference the document in its reply. Does anyone here have any useful prompting techniques which could solve my problem?
7/2/23, 09:32 - +91 63695 89236: Use chat completion model
7/2/23, 09:32 - +91 63695 89236: And use system message to tell the system how it supposed to answersl

7/3/23, 12:13 - +91 88103 86510: Soon GPT-4 will be dethroned also. Some of its architecture details are public already and there is research like Orca, Open Orca etc which are boosting open-source LLM progress
7/3/23, 13:11 - +91 88103 86510: Update: https://twitter.com/lmsysorg/status/1675612625273761793?t=iE9DJO4cnhLJzEQ4CDbhwQ&s=19
7/3/23, 13:13 - +91 88103 86510: Open-source LLMs haven't beaten GPT-3.5 yet. But remember that these open source LLMs 13b parameters whereas GPT-3.5 has 170B+ parameters and is being trained by reinforcement learning on millions of users data. So it's so impressive that open source LLMs are reaching there despite so limited resources.

7/3/23, 17:36 - +91 98919 01981: here is an example
7/3/23, 17:36 - +91 72474 89270: As per my knowledge there are two ways of doing it
7/3/23, 17:37 - +91 72474 89270: Load CSV in pandas and put head and summary of dataframe into the LLM and ask it to generate code for your queries
7/3/23, 17:38 - +91 72474 89270: Second is to loads data in a db like ducks db and ask LLM to generate SQL queries

7/3/23, 18:05 - +91 72474 89270: This is something I was experimenting with last month
7/3/23, 18:07 - +91 72474 89270: haven't seen a product like this but it is pretty easy to make this
7/3/23, 19:17 - +91 90215 66239: There is supermeme.ai and was #1 on Product hunt last year.
7/3/23, 19:18 - +91 72474 89270: This can also be done with gpt-3 so no surprise if it was made a while ago
7/3/23, 19:18 - +91 72474 89270: But with ChatGPT the iterative editing experience is really great
7/3/23, 19:42 - +91 90031 35354: Very useful one üëçüòÉ
7/3/23, 19:50 - +91 79000 49987: It's really great idea to work with but while I was trying with the Bitcoin data and putting the query, it worked for the basic question as it tries to write code in pandas and then results it, but fails at plotting many times.
7/3/23, 20:14 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Talking to documents is just a technical feature. You have unlimited use cases that can solve real pain points that people are willing to pay for. I just implemented a portal in After sales applications to automate troubleshooting and guarantee claims. This saves time and money to companies and can be operational 24/7.. <This message was edited>

7/3/23, 20:29 - +91 96181 27848: Hi, I need to know what are your thoughts on this project: Analyze multilingual (Indian languages - English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali etc.) audio conversations and create a report  about the conversation in the language that was mostly used in the conversation. Note that the report can be in any of the indian languages. Do you think it is even possible with any paid / open source software?
7/3/23, 20:37 - +44 7404 656243: @919618127848 do I understand right that you want to analyze a single conversation with multiple languages? i.e question in Hindi, answer in Telugu ?
7/3/23, 20:37 - +44 7404 656243: time for a job change ?
7/3/23, 20:38 - +91 72474 89270: @447404656243 hiring?
7/3/23, 20:38 - +91 94825 40097: Well, I‚Äôm trying to build my side project and WLB is kinda chill and pay is good. So, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna change for at least 6 months
7/3/23, 20:38 - +27 82 775 8235: But why is this an important Data point to capture and report on?
7/3/23, 20:39 - +91 96181 27848: For most of the cases we can assume two people are talking and they are talking in only one language.
7/3/23, 20:40 - +91 96181 27848: To understand what they are talking about
7/3/23, 20:41 - +44 7404 656243: I see so what could potentially work is split the large audio into individual conversations (and individual conversations would be single language) and go from there .. is this multilingual conversation a real life scenario?
7/3/23, 20:42 - +91 96181 27848: Yes, we can think of a conversation between doctor and a patient
7/3/23, 20:43 - +44 7404 656243: sometimes I do hire freelancers or interns - trying to build a few products on the side with a goal to return to India next year üòÄ but next year when I am back I will set things up properly
7/3/23, 20:45 - +91 72474 89270: Giving out small projects/modules to freelancers is a nice way of recruiting Devs for long term engagement

7/7/23, 11:11 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Looks interesting, but it seems to be a cloud only solution. I'm trying to save my users money by implementing open source models that can run offline
7/7/23, 11:11 - +91 93663 18323: Anyone with good roadmap for ML/AI
7/7/23, 11:14 - +91 96869 13429: Can we use that model for commercial
7/7/23, 11:15 - +91 98919 01981: Yes it's a paid model like gpt3.5
7/7/23, 11:17 - +91 91132 06642: You should try H2O.io - I think this might have an offline solution.
7/7/23, 11:18 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Seems like the winner would be Palm2 according to bing GPT running at only 10mbs! Sure, I can sort the models by memory size in descending order and format them without a table. Here is the result:

- Dolly 3B is an open source offline model with 3 billion parameters and 6 GB of memory size. It can run on cloud devices.
- Alpaca is an open source offline model with unknown parameters and memory size, but they are likely to be in the range of billions and gigabytes. It can run on laptop, desktop, and cloud devices.
- GPT-2 ggml is an open source offline model with 117 million to 774 million parameters and 251 MB to 1.55 GB of memory size. It can run on desktop devices.
- CerebrasGPT is an open source offline model with 111 million parameters and 100 MB of memory size. It can run on laptop devices.
- Ada is an open source offline model with 350 million parameters and 224 MB of memory size. It can run on laptop devices.
- Pythia Deduped is an open source offline model with 70 million parameters and 45 MB of memory size. It can run on Raspberry Pi devices.
- PaLM 2 is an open source offline model with 20 million parameters and 10 MB of memory size. It can run on mobile devices.

I hope this helps. üòä
7/7/23, 11:18 - +91 96869 13429: Is there any  source code  or notebook for building   transformer model from scratch like chatgpt very small model where we can use that model for commercial
7/7/23, 11:21 - +1 (818) 620-8536: This one?: Yes, I do know of an LLM offered by a company called H2O.io. It's called **H2O LLM Studio**¬π, and it's a framework and no-code GUI designed for fine-tuning state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). With H2O LLM Studio, you can easily and effectively fine-tune LLMs without the need for any coding experience, use advanced evaluation metrics, chat with your model, and export your model to the Hugging Face Hub¬≥. H2O LLM Studio also supports recent finetuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and 8-bit model training with a low memory footprint‚Å¥. H2O LLM Studio is an open source tool with a GitHub repository¬≤. You can download it from here¬π.

7/7/23, 11:43 - +91 95583 33464: Any suggestions on using LLM or other algorithms for keyword clustering. We are at the bottleneck of improving the clusters. 
We are using HDBSCAN currently. The problem we are facing is it considers 70-80% of the keywords as outliers. 
We have generated the embeddings using BERT MLM
7/7/23, 11:45 - +91 84387 68286: What u guys think about prolog, lisp, Haskell,Scala, Julia, GNU Octave like programming language which are alternative to python to develop AI applications.
7/7/23, 12:50 - +91 94825 40097: Mojo looks promising
7/7/23, 13:05 - +91 84387 68286: Yes
7/7/23, 13:05 - +44 7404 656243: did anyone get hold of sdxl model ?
7/7/23, 13:15 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Best one is probably rust, great speed, awesome thread parallelization, and a great ecosystem that languages like Haskell lack. More importantly, you can compile your code to web assembly for high performance client side code that you can bind into node or python. Otherwise you can wait a couple years for Mojo to come out.
7/7/23, 13:16 - +91 84387 68286: Oh. Couple years wait to use mojo?
7/7/23, 13:18 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Yeah there's a lot of hype for it but officially it's still in early works, without a solid specification to outline the languages design. The creators want to work out the details by taking community suggestions before committing any code. They want to future proof the language. So as of now there's nothing available for us.
7/7/23, 13:28 - +91 84387 68286: Oh. Cleared.

7/7/23, 15:55 - +91 84148 94286: It's using Observation-Action-Thought, it's most probably an agent using search tools.
7/7/23, 15:55 - +91 98104 85533: I meant the name of the chain in langchain specifically
7/7/23, 16:01 - +91 96119 30033: give more context, like your background, things you already know, and what you want to do after you go through the roadmap
7/7/23, 16:02 - +91 96119 30033: Humans, like LLMs, are better with outputs if you have good input prompts üôÇ
7/7/23, 16:31 - +91 91638 27035: I don't know. I am just exploring to understand what should I learn to get into this field
7/7/23, 19:12 - +91 97767 76943: Hey, are you an AI engineer experimenting with LangChain? If so drop me a message, we can collaborate on a cool product..
7/7/23, 19:21 - +91 94825 40097: GPT 4 is out for all ?

7/7/23, 19:26 - +91 91638 27035: I was once banned from OpenAI
7/7/23, 19:33 - +91 94825 40097: It‚Äôs available for people who have history of payment it seems

7/7/23, 22:00 - +91 99712 24643: GPT4 has been around a while. Isn‚Äôt it?
7/7/23, 22:07 - +91 98882 00891: Hey fam ,
I have a question.
I have built Apple shortcuts for personal use using open AI API . 

Do open ai has access to my conversations?
7/7/23, 22:13 - +91 88873 00821: yes and no maybe
7/7/23, 22:13 - +91 88873 00821: if you're using your own Key, you can opt out of training on the data you provide to them.
7/7/23, 22:14 - +91 84602 38402: No check their privacy policy

https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy
7/7/23, 22:15 - +91 98882 00891: Thank you @918460238402 
I‚Äôll have a look on this
7/7/23, 22:16 - +91 84148 94286: my team account got the access today. I noticed that gpt4 doesn‚Äôt show up on the drop-down on the playground.  I could access only clicking on the open in playground link in the mail. 

I had access previously access due to being part of US organisation that had GPT4 access. There I can access directly in the drop-down.
7/7/23, 22:17 - +91 94825 40097: Strange
7/7/23, 22:18 - +91 84148 94286: If you are not seeing the model on the playground, try this link:

https://platform.openai.com/playground?model=gpt-4
7/7/23, 22:19 - +91 94825 40097: The model: `gpt-4` does not exist
7/7/23, 22:19 - +91 94825 40097: i submitted a text, this shows
7/7/23, 22:20 - +91 84148 94286: Then it might not be enabled for your account yet.
7/7/23, 22:20 - +91 94825 40097: yup
7/8/23, 01:28 - +91 79000 49987: Heya Everyone, 

Anyone who have worked on the chat with csv or doing data analysis or visualization on your csv data using langchain. I will I was woking using the create_pandas_dataframe_agent, none of my query gives the output and it infinetly finds everytime.
7/8/23, 01:28 - +91 79000 49987: Any resources to follow up ?
7/8/23, 09:21 - +91 95464 58031: ChatGPT Plus has Code Interpreter now so you can try that, it's basically your personal data analyst
7/8/23, 11:18 - +91 79000 49987: Codex model of OpenAI also works best for generating the code, the code interpreter is a plugin in plus ?
7/8/23, 12:18 - +91 94487 19072: IS this event happening today ?
7/8/23, 12:35 - +91 72196 52039: Yup
7/8/23, 12:44 - +919156212345: Yes. I did not receive approval unfortunately. I was quite excited :/
7/8/23, 14:51 - +91 84148 94286: Try using function calling. First all divide your task into series of small function tasks. For instance, 
1. Matplotlib function
2. Array sizing function
3. Graph generating function etc

Use the main  openAI function as router function to decide on which function to be used. 

I am working on similar thing, ( relates to stock, calculating DCF, reading quaterly earning calls report etc) And breaking down into functions is giving more accurate results than relying on the whims of the agent.
7/8/23, 15:31 - +44 7404 656243: Look at matcha repos too.. It has chat with csv example
7/8/23, 16:12 - +91 97767 76943: Is it going on? Couldn‚Äôt join due to other few things, would it make sense to join in last hour?
7/8/23, 16:23 - +91 72196 52039: Yup, it is going on. It is running late by 30-40 mins
7/8/23, 16:24 - +91 72196 52039: The talks are going good. Not sure about last hour talks. But u could come and talk to people. That's invaluable!
7/8/23, 16:24 - +91 84148 94286: Does anyone know any consulting companies that can make small mobile game? Someone I know is looking to build a prototype.
7/8/23, 20:20 - +91 91367 42031: Guys we web2sys.com , here we provide different AI services in different industries and many more tech and innovation related works, your clients list include Indian Navy as well , so if any individual or firm or any sector industrialists wants their business to boost through AI services, they can freely reach me out .

My friend was a high school guy. The topic are related to many future technology.

AI and ML is one of the topics. He approached me to make Project for him. But that project should not be in google. If it is, It will be disqualified.

If u have any idea. Let's share. Just 7 days more for the competition. Just a try

7/10/23, 10:16 - +91 88103 86510: Only comparable model is cloude+, but even that doesn't beat reasoning and logical capabilities of gpt4
7/10/23, 12:13 - +91 7397 360 520: Anyone knows a good background removal python code/API ?


I tried openCV, U-2 net, pics art API.


 It is not working with my use case and not precise.
7/10/23, 12:13 - +91 7397 360 520: The API ideally I want it under $0.1 per call
7/10/23, 12:16 - +91 84148 94286: Hear good things about clipdrop from stability but not sure if they an api https://clipdrop.co/remove-background
7/10/23, 12:18 - +91 73877 90163: Cool
7/10/23, 12:18 - +91 84148 94286: https://clipdrop.co/apis they have. 350 rupees for unlimited removal . Sound too good to be true though
7/10/23, 12:19 - +91 88103 86510: Clipdrop is legit, it is powered by stabilityai who make stable diffusion
7/10/23, 12:20 - +91 84148 94286: Have you tried it?? How‚Äôs the experience??

7/10/23, 12:23 - +91 88103 86510: Not used
7/10/23, 12:23 - +91 88103 86510: You can check trial

7/10/23, 12:38 - +91 84148 94286: https://clipdrop.co/pricing this is for the gui
7/10/23, 12:38 - +91 88103 86510: Ok

7/10/23, 14:27 - +91 72474 89270: These paid tools use different segmentation methods based on the image type
7/10/23, 14:27 - +91 72474 89270: That is why you are getting better results for vector graphics
7/10/23, 14:29 - +44 7404 656243: I have a lot of credits for this too - https://backgroundcut.co/
Do you want to try @917397360520 ? Its got an api

7/10/23, 19:03 - +91 75740 69119: Hi, facing an error while calling the gpt3.5 turbo model using openAI api

Error shows quota has reached the limit which I have just opened new account only
Called the model for the first time and got an error
Any idea on how to take it up?
7/10/23, 19:08 - +91 98104 85533: Use both api key and org id in the api call. Sometimes I have seen that it fails to calculate org level quota otherwise
7/10/23, 19:08 - +91 98104 85533: curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \

7/13/23, 02:08 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Off the top of my head, I would web scrape the profile(s) desired, and simply ask gpt3.5 to analyze all data relevant to the user with the intent of replicating their persona. If you did some prompt engineering you can probably get better results.

7/13/23, 08:17 - +91 88103 86510: You can fine-tune a good opensource model to achieve exact style
7/13/23, 08:37 - +91 84475 45891: Interested üëã
7/13/23, 08:39 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): I think this would be enough. 
I've seen people mimicking naval ravikant, Elon Musk with this approach. 
Prompt Engineering is the key here.
7/13/23, 08:43 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): I still find fine tuning very cumbersome. 
After failing all manual attempts, I created my fine-tuning training data using AutoGPT. 
Still the dataset was not what I wanted so had to scrape the project. 

Any recent advancements, which is making fine tuning easier?
7/13/23, 08:44 - +91 88103 86510: Have you tried using h2o LLM studio?
7/13/23, 08:44 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): No, not yet
7/13/23, 08:44 - +91 88103 86510: Try it, it's a tool which makes LLM related tasks easier
7/13/23, 08:45 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Does that help in creating training data?
7/13/23, 08:45 - +91 88103 86510: https://h2o.ai/blog/effortless-fine-tuning-of-large-language-models-with-open-source-h2o-llm-studio/
7/13/23, 08:45 - +91 88103 86510: I don't think so
7/13/23, 08:47 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): I'll check this
7/13/23, 08:47 - +91 88103 86510: Can you tell how you generate with AutoGPT?
7/13/23, 08:48 - +91 88103 86510: Also if posts are not long, you can use a prompt with 4-5 examples and ask gpt to write in same style
7/13/23, 08:48 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Yes, but the response was not satisfactory to train. Plus it took like 20 iterations
7/13/23, 08:48 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): No so my usecase was different
7/13/23, 08:48 - +91 88103 86510: GPT3.5 isn't able to do that accurately, but GPT-4 does that good
7/13/23, 08:49 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Still on waitlist
7/13/23, 08:49 - +91 88103 86510: Oh. If you asked it to do web scraping, it's not gonna work due to rate limits and stuff
7/13/23, 08:49 - +91 88103 86510: Don't wait for OpenAI, their platform is shit, use others, there's lots of services which give gpt4 for same price or cheaper
7/13/23, 08:50 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): No so the response generated were not adequate.
So my usecase was to fine tune gpt 3.5 for a web3 based business validator/resource manager
7/13/23, 08:51 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): I use others for chat, but not for building stuffs, can you mention few?
7/13/23, 08:51 - +91 88103 86510: I see. Well for data you will have to either make manually or try some other way
7/13/23, 08:51 - +91 88103 86510: AutoGPT just burns credits and it seems to always get stuck in unnecessary tasks loop
7/13/23, 08:51 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Exactly, it didn't work so had to scrape it finally.
7/13/23, 08:52 - +91 88103 86510: I would say that you should try InstructGPT like technique
7/13/23, 08:52 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Nothing like auto,
I had to run feedback analysis, and better prompts at every step.
More like manualGPT
7/13/23, 08:52 - +91 88103 86510: Get some real samples, then ask a smart model like gpt4 to generate more similar examples
7/13/23, 08:52 - +91 88103 86510: Then grade those with GPT-4 and keep the good ones
7/13/23, 08:53 - +91 88103 86510: Exactly.
7/13/23, 08:53 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Okay, this looks promising. I'll try it out
7/13/23, 08:53 - +91 88103 86510: To save credits, you can do this step with a good opensource LLM and then use some way to rate the text
7/13/23, 08:54 - +91 88103 86510: I read somewhere that there are some models which can calculate style similarity of text. Try exploring that
7/13/23, 08:55 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Okay, sureüëçüèª
Thanksüíô
7/13/23, 08:57 - +91 88103 86510: And remember, even 1k dataset which is very high quality will be better than a low quality 10k dataset, so focus on maintaining quality of dataset

7/13/23, 11:08 - +91 88103 86510: I think a better approach will be to use opensource model for most of the tasks, gpt 3.5 for basic grading, gpt4 for defining tasks and logical parts
7/13/23, 11:08 - +91 88103 86510: That will be excellent system
7/13/23, 11:08 - +27 82 775 8235: Yes very vague but maybe new marketing tactic from Musk to wow the world at his right moment
Create suspense and then boom
7/13/23, 11:08 - +91 88103 86510: And now that orca preview is released, soon open-source LLMs will beat gpt 3.5

7/13/23, 11:09 - +91 88103 86510: With just 6% training it's approaching orca benchmarks in many areas

My friend's name is Hari. This is his mobile number  7406699030
7/13/23, 15:47 - +91 84148 94286: The whole idea of langchain is that you can swap out source LLM model with any model of your liking. Try creating a custom LLM -> https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms/how_to/custom_llm

And use it for your agent
7/13/23, 15:48 - +91 84148 94286: Also, if you are going to perform this, then do run some evals comparing GPTs and custom LLM and share results. I have always wondered the efficiency of these models

7/13/23, 19:59 - +44 7404 656243: got it - so this is how I would go about it...
7/13/23, 20:01 - +44 7404 656243: Start researching the potential investors (you can use crunchbase etc..) then you have to find out which partner in the firm is most likely to be one who works in this sector. Start finding people who can introduce you to the investor - usually you may get through to associates and you have to work your way up to the partners. So best way is to get someone to refer you
once you have mvp and have some validation -

Currently, investors are hungry to bet on AI so people end up raising more then they need.

7/13/23, 21:42 - +91 97246 54616: Two things are at play from investors side;

1. AI is fundamental shift in tech so every investors want to join bandwagon. Of course, some will have huge wins. 

2. Indian VCs are sitting on $16Bn of dry powder & all other sectors are grappled in deep funding winter so investors certainly can't have patience for long.

If the texts are completely different like address and product name (retail) you can do it separately. But word2vec models do not consider order of words in text, so you might be better served with sequential models (Transformer based models being popular)

7/18/23, 23:13 - +91 99984 30495: Sure. Ig you need to do EDA and figure out which of these fields are fake in a fake job posting.

I have lots of Questions and Answers Sample - How to utilise this to find relevant answers to new Questions. I only want to use just Open Source LLMs

Now I want to build a model in such that, It can learn from the given data and pull out the relevant answer if a new Question is given
7/20/23, 09:02 - +1 (862) 754-4963: fine tuning a model will be costly use embeddings and make the model quote the answers

7/20/23, 12:49 - +27 82 775 8235: Hi all,
Pls HELP.  I am struggling to understand the architecture of AI models.  

I understand that it is based on LLM and that that it gone through learning process and keeps on learning as people use it.

What I am struggling with is the implementation in business using business data as the reference.

Does anybody have a high elvel architecture diagram of what this would look like?
Can you "lock" it down to only use the reference data?
How mature would the data analytics design architecure of the business be before seeing the true value of BI?
Does there need to be an existing working Data Anayltics archtiect in place that is already producign realtime data albeit with the help of data analysts writing scripts etc?

Would help if you have one page infographics that answer the above, similar to attached  ?

Thx

7/20/23, 12:52 - +91 98308 87243: Hi all,
I want to learn and explore the world of Generative AI and LLMs. I have completed Deep learning and have idea of how GAN works. Can anyone tell me where I can start from to have a good understanding upto implementation level in Gen Ai?
I have already watched the introductory courses on Google for GenAi track and I want to explore more depth and build projects. Can anyone please guide me
7/20/23, 12:56 - +91 88103 86510: I think you are looking for vector db.
You can run query through vector db and get results from the data that you add in vector db
Then pass that data along with query to LLM for more detailed answers
7/20/23, 12:56 - +91 88103 86510: Part 2 of fast.ai course
7/20/23, 13:33 - +91 99399 82369: Is there a lambdalabs alternative that accepts payments in crypto?
7/20/23, 13:35 - +91 88103 86510: Why
7/20/23, 13:36 - +91 99399 82369: because in my previous company I got all my salary in crypto :)
Would be easier if I dont have to convert to fiat each time
7/20/23, 14:08 - +91 84148 94286: Runpod has pay with crypto option. Although runpod doesn‚Äôt give you full machine access. It provides docker containers. I use it for stable diffusion mostly so it works for me.
7/20/23, 14:35 - +44 7404 656243: wow - I am hearing this for the first time. How do you feel about it Kinshuk ?
7/20/23, 14:36 - +91 72474 89270: Is it a fiat backed currency?
7/20/23, 14:37 - +91 72474 89270: I can't imagine paying my employees in a fluctuating crypto
7/20/23, 14:56 - +91 99399 82369: Yeah I got payments in USDC, doesn't fluctuate

Its mainly because the company itself recieved funding in stablecoins, so it made sense

I think it might become more commonplace once there are more clear regulations in india. I personally dont have a problem with it
7/20/23, 14:58 - +91 99399 82369: Runpod looks really neat btw, thanks üôè
7/20/23, 17:16 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Hey guys, I'm currently working with gpt3 function calls, highly recommend it for precision output:

https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates?ref=upstract.com
7/20/23, 17:18 - +91 63695 89236: Can share your use case and experience
7/20/23, 17:31 - +1 (818) 620-8536: I wanted to automate my git management. Put simply, documenting every file change with a good description is tiresome at best. So I considered querying LLMs to write the message for me. However I needed to copy and paste my git diff of the given file into the UI every time. With function calls you can send a request like "Write a commit message based on the following git diff" and voila, your guaranteed a structured json response that you can take apart. The result is AI powered git management. Check it out:
https://gist.github.com/TheGonzalezDesigns/88307f87963e4a6f90e0e70fa4284933
7/20/23, 17:33 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Unlike the example given in the official article. I managed to bring down the api calls from two to one.
7/20/23, 17:42 - +91 88103 86510: Where do you convert crypto to fiat?
7/20/23, 17:44 - +65 9647 3945: Any idea which opensource bot builder like typebot / chatterbox / rasa is advisable for building a AI chatbot with multi-agent & human passover feature?
7/20/23, 17:47 - +91 92050 66063: Not open source but you can build it with BotPress.

We and our clients have had good experience with it especially with the human passover feature.
7/20/23, 17:51 - +1 (818) 620-8536: WazirX, CoinDCX, Binance India, CoinSwitch Kuber, ZebPay for crypto to fiat in India.
7/20/23, 18:00 - +91 88103 86510: Be careful from P2P scams. Lots of account getting freezed by cybercell.
7/20/23, 18:26 - +91 99399 82369: I usually use Binance P2P, and break up large sums into chunks of <20K
7/20/23, 18:26 - +91 88103 86510: Accounts getting frozen for as little as 1k
7/20/23, 18:27 - +91 88103 86510: Just search on google, binance P2P account freeze
7/20/23, 18:27 - +91 99399 82369: interesting, have you noticed any pattern for the accounts that got frozen?

I've been using this method for 2-3 years without issue
7/20/23, 18:28 - +91 88103 86510: It's happening since last 7-8 months heavily. Basically buyer will buy crypto and send fraud money. Or he himself will report that you did fraud. Then cybercell freezes account without any investigation. Not only the account reported, but also multiple level chain where that money went.
7/20/23, 18:29 - +91 88103 86510: So lots of traders account getting frozen due to this transaction chain issue. Like a -> b -> c -> d all get frozen
7/20/23, 18:29 - +91 88103 86510: You can see videos about it on YouTube also
7/20/23, 18:29 - +91 88103 86510: And on twitter many people post every day
7/20/23, 18:41 - +91 70160 21782: People I know are using it with verified buyers and sellers at little higher rate than market price.
7/20/23, 18:42 - +91 88103 86510: Even then, the chain freeze is a issue. And it's happening a LOT
7/20/23, 18:42 - +91 70160 21782: I know happened with me on WazirX
7/20/23, 18:42 - +91 88103 86510: They freeze upto 6-7 levels if they want
7/20/23, 18:49 - +91 88103 86510: So how did you unfreeze?
7/20/23, 18:56 - +91 70160 21782: Took help of category A officer of my hometown.
7/20/23, 18:56 - +91 88103 86510: Nice. What's the procedure?

7/20/23, 19:15 - +91 70160 21782: I would rephrase "hype" to "distribution cycle"
7/20/23, 19:53 - +91 88103 86510: :/
7/20/23, 23:18 - +91 81282 95151: I am deploying the flask app in gcloud app engine, but after deployment I am getting 500 server error anyone knew what can go wrong? Because in local api is running perfectly
7/20/23, 23:21 - +91 89087 56505: probably some error related to its host and port. For the server some extra settings need to be configured I guess.
7/20/23, 23:23 - +91 98104 85533: port cannot be bound. i think u must have bound 8000 or something.

Can anyone say that it is the correct way to deploy?
port:- app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
7/20/23, 23:48 - +91 89087 56505: may be some firewall settings needs to be configured to enable that port, or try changing it's value to 8080 or 5000 something.
7/20/23, 23:49 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Corn was among the first to implement Virtual Reality, NFTs for OF girls... AI is no different
7/20/23, 23:50 - +91 98104 85533: change it to 80. GAE will only allow binding to port 80
7/20/23, 23:52 - +91 98104 85533: read the doc here - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/runtime#entrypoint_best_practices

7/21/23, 13:40 - +91 63695 89236: I'll share my plan
7/21/23, 13:44 - +91 88103 86510: Why do you need so much support? xyzGPT = fine-tune on that data
7/21/23, 13:44 - +91 88103 86510: Just fine-tune it on dharmik texts and dharmagpt is ready XD
7/21/23, 13:44 - +91 88103 86510: Everyone thinking they are xyzGPT in the hype
7/21/23, 13:49 - +91 63695 89236: Reason. There is many parts to running a product. Front end, Backend research,devops, marketing, pr. Plus I'm more of a business guy than technical expert. Lastly I'm putting 50k per month of my own money into this project which in doing as service (seva) to the community and nation. Hence I need support as everyone time is limited due to day job. Our plans are big, any one seriously interested please pm me I'll share my planning with you for feedback. Currently I'm doing this myself by using vector db + openai. But want to fine tune and run out own models. I already have approval of some of the big spiritual ashrams in India.

7/21/23, 20:42 - +1 (778) 888-9061: Professionally, I use JIT compilers for creating a sandbox to dynamically analyze malware. But, nowadays, I'm more getting inclined towards ML compilers and their optimizations.

7/22/23, 16:35 - +91 63695 89236: hows the claude api compare to gpt4? anyone has experience/feedback?
7/22/23, 17:07 - +61 451 126 325: I've tried autoGPT, I think it's not worth the hype, plus costs get too high. I have had better cost efficiencies while building something specific by just using chatGPT at each step..GPT agents work better for exploratory ideas involving brainstorming but for building something specific, it's still better off without them

7/22/23, 19:40 - +1 (818) 620-8536: The underlying architecture is inherently flawed. Too lenient in the sense that AI has complete control but doesn't know how to stay on task, like if it was a genius toddler with ADHD.

As you would have figured out by now, LLaMa-2-Chat is heavily censored, to the point that it is unusable. It denies to answer even perfectly valid questions like "how to disable ufw" or "how to kill java process".
In this article, I provide a way to bypass it's censorship for your business purposes.

7/23/23, 11:20 - +91 88103 86510: gpt-4 is trained on these trick questions. LLMs can't answer these questions by their knowledge, because they can't handle math well

7/23/23, 19:42 - +91 88103 86510: you can try following:
sagemaker

7/23/23, 19:43 - +91 90478 63124: I want to integrate the fine tuned model to run in the GPU cloud and consume it through the API.
7/23/23, 19:44 - +91 90478 63124: Will check, thanks. Has anybody tried converting a fine tuned model to C++ and integrated with real time transcription?
7/23/23, 19:45 - +91 88103 86510: generally all the heavy work is done in c/c++/machine code. tensorflow, pytorch etc are like a wrapper which call compiled libraries for heavy-lifting

7/24/23, 15:25 - +91 88103 86510: Like roleplay, discussions etc
7/24/23, 16:12 - +91 73877 90163: It's Not That Easy Though, My Team At Scale Is Working On The Same, We Are Training AI Models At Complex And Hard Problems That Requires Algorithms Like FFT, Combinatorics, DP. In Next 1 Years You Will Be Seeing LLM's Giving Answers To Codeforces Problems!

7/24/23, 16:26 - +91 97246 54616: Apart form advance math application,  'Calculator+LLM' is fair enough to solve majority of comman use cases.  üòÑ
7/24/23, 16:26 - +91 88103 86510: An LLM which can use programming for itself can do a lot

Is this happening around 7-8th?
7/27/23, 11:59 - +91 97246 54616: Will be in Ahmedabad. üòä
7/27/23, 14:31 - +91 98308 87243: https://meet.google.com/ucn-enrz-zwr
7/27/23, 19:51 - +91 63695 89236: free idea for the builders out there: google is useless. do you find yourself suffixing 'reddit' or 'stackoverflow' to your search queries? 

in that case we can make reddit ai. so it can take your query, search on reddit and provide answer based on discussions. 

e.g. which is best mobile for camera. it collects data from reddit and gives you answer.
7/27/23, 19:51 - +91 63695 89236: anyone wanna build with me pm me i will teach you how to build this full stack
7/27/23, 19:57 - +91 74116 35116: We can already do this using perplexity.ai . Am I missing anything ?
7/27/23, 20:00 - +91 63695 89236: yep same thing. difference is branding, your execution and internal algos. perplexity results are not that good because i think it doesnt take into account upvoves of the asnwers.
7/27/23, 20:11 - +91 99399 82369: How do you deal with the fact that many subreddits have gone private
7/27/23, 20:12 - +91 63695 89236: good question. i dont know. my initial thought is to use langchain google search tool and then scrape using pupeteer/playwright. so if private = we cannot access.
7/27/23, 20:25 - +91 83769 13427: Hey all,
I'm working on my first project and I just wanted to share it with you all.
I'm making https://nous.fyi/.
It's supposed to help you save, search, and retrieve your own pockets of knowledge online. I'm starting with trying to make your browser bookmarks searchable and accessible so that you can find what you need and get on with your work.

I'm quite excited to finally launch a waitlist/landing page and am happy to discuss and talk more.

7/27/23, 20:25 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Hi all I am ready to go to production with my new product. Has anyone worked on launch before ? Any recommendations ? It‚Äôs an ai tool related to audio so I was thinking on implementing a free version on the website hero section with some restrictions and a paid version if they want unlocked version . Are there any other strategies ?
7/27/23, 20:26 - +91 83769 13427: For specifically product related queries, check out https://www.looria.com/
7/27/23, 20:27 - +91 83769 13427: Twitter is your best bet, some discord servers
7/27/23, 20:27 - +91 83769 13427: For people to get a first look at your product i think
7/27/23, 20:28 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: We should curate a list of channels to launch product. It‚Äôs invaluable.
7/27/23, 20:29 - +91 63695 89236: yeah i am also looking for product launch plan. would love to brainstorm on this. anyone wanna have a discusioon on this?
7/27/23, 20:29 - +91 63695 89236: good idea
7/27/23, 20:30 - +91 63695 89236: can suggest any

7/27/23, 21:41 - +1 (818) 620-8536: I've done it on my own and it's pretty easy. What surprises me is how fast Amazon Alexa does it, near instant compared to say bing GPT which is on average 10 to 20s for me. I'm going to be making another one via Rust and Tokio threading to see if I can get it under 3 seconds
7/27/23, 21:44 - +91 63695 89236: You mean reddit ude
7/27/23, 21:44 - +91 63695 89236: Idea
7/27/23, 21:45 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Use Twitter as the start of your sales funnel, then a kick-ass landing page showcasing your product, then a free trial or free-tier sign up where you explain why paid is better ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
7/27/23, 21:46 - +1 (818) 620-8536: I mean in general, the concept of AI search has been done many times so the game is accuracy, relevancy and speed.
7/27/23, 21:47 - +91 63695 89236: Correct
7/27/23, 21:47 - +91 63695 89236: Data retrieval is the top problem
7/27/23, 21:51 - +1 (818) 620-8536: I bet if we were to query not just Google but aggregate the first 10 results of Yandex, bing DDG etc... Then use AI to summarize it all, we'd have better results.
7/27/23, 21:56 - +91 99399 82369: All these sites have the SEO problem, will end up with garbage in, garbage out
7/27/23, 21:56 - +91 97452 50986 joined using this group's invite link
7/27/23, 21:59 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Sort of, if you were to prompt the AI "extract and summarize all data relating to <query>..." It should filter out the garbage. But you are still right that SEO is a Nerf to search results
7/27/23, 22:11 - +91 63695 89236: Good idea. Also the title/question on reddit page we can match vector embedding with the user's question to select the correct pages to use for the answer
7/27/23, 22:11 - +91 63695 89236: The above will solve this also
7/27/23, 22:14 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Absolutely unfortunately now we are trading relevancy for speed, correct me if I'm wrong but our AI would have to consume the reddit pages to our vector embeddings before producing "citations" which would take over a few seconds no? Is there a way around the extra delay

7/29/23, 08:06 - +1 (601) 519-7640: Yes, I have heard about the AI-powered brain cell. It is a project by the University of Melbourne and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to develop an artificial brain cell that can learn and adapt in a similar way to a biological brain cell. The project was awarded a $600,000 grant from the Australian government in 2021.

The AI-powered brain cell is based on a type of artificial intelligence called a spiking neural network. Spiking neural networks are inspired by the way that biological neurons communicate with each other. In a biological neuron, a signal is transmitted when a certain threshold of voltage is reached. This signal is called a spike. Spiking neural networks use spikes to transmit information between different nodes in the network.

The AI-powered brain cell that is being developed by the University of Melbourne and CSIRO is designed to be able to learn and adapt in a similar way to a biological brain cell. The cell will be able to learn from its environment and improve its performance over time. The cell is also designed to be able to adapt to new situations.

The development of the AI-powered brain cell is still in its early stages, but the project has the potential to make significant advances in the field of artificial intelligence. The cell could be used to develop new types of artificial intelligence that are more capable of learning and adapting. The cell could also be used to develop new medical treatments for neurological disorders.

Here are some of the potential applications of AI-powered brain cells:

Medical research: AI-powered brain cells could be used to study the human brain and develop new treatments for neurological disorders.
Robotics: AI-powered brain cells could be used to develop more intelligent robots that can learn and adapt to their environment.
Artificial intelligence: AI-powered brain cells could be used to develop new types of artificial intelligence that are more capable of learning and adapting.
The development of AI-powered brain cells is a promising area of research with the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence.

In my opinion, its not just about Netflix, its about this new wave of integrating agents into businesses' workflow. Netflix have just validated the market. I have been working on deploying finetuned Llama models on companies' private data as the don't wanna use an openapi wrapper app but their own context-aware gpt. I've been working with self-prompting, agent-spawning, CoT agents for a while and I think (imho) this fusion will be the fastest way to get end-to-end "managers" for businesses but more imporantly, AGI.

7/30/23, 21:26 - +91 63695 89236: which one you tried
7/30/23, 21:27 - +91 88103 86510: i tried prompting gpt3.5 by giving it news articles
7/30/23, 21:29 - +91 63695 89236: you have to make it specific by industry and purpsoe of newsletter (e.g. informative/ sales flow/ customer engagement. 

in system prompt train the ai to say ' you are an expert email marketer. you work as a marketing professional in the <abc/ecommerce> industry. you are writing an email sequence to the end user to educate him about your saas product salesforce. the product helps sales professionsa ... <insert your propduct details here> 

Create a 3 emails email sequence to engage the user and slowly push him towards trying out your product. 

You must be enganging without hard selling.
7/30/23, 21:29 - +91 63695 89236: basically detailed prompt engineering gives better results

7/30/23, 21:30 - +91 63695 89236: give the gpt 3 things in the prompt
1. what is the context he will get
2. what is the expected output
3. train the bot on 'who he is'

be very specific and it gives better results

If the same is applied to all Electronic items like Mobiles, Laptops, TV, Fridge, Washing Machine, ACs, Water Purifiers, Air purifiers, etc - it'll be amazing üî•

Some Foreign brand products are very good in durability but the issue is some spare parts take much longer to arrive due to imports, but if they start manufacturing everything in India then we all can get best high quality products for low price and good service of products and quick delivery of spare parts üëèüòÄ <This message was edited>
8/4/23, 17:19 - +91 79790 79505: Jio laptop will have no impact based on this,

It's mainly the cost of Laptops and a try to move the semiconductor industry from China to India.
8/4/23, 17:20 - +91 79790 79505: Once succeeded with 1-2 MNCs, it will create a fomo effect in thr ever-growing market
8/4/23, 17:20 - +44 7404 656243: Its a bold move - I like it

Dont you think?
8/4/23, 17:45 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: I have reservations for banning importations. Nothing should be banned but you can increase import taxes. Banning will just improve black markets. Building laptops is not a viable option if there is no ecosystem for d√©veloppement and if the laws are not enterprise friendly.
8/4/23, 17:54 - +91 79790 79505: Eventually everyone will deploy from China,

So the only option is to build market tension to invest in what builds smartphone, graphic card, basically every single device.

Semiconductor 

The
8/4/23, 17:55 - +91 80560 03152: So true, now all the leading players are going to run behind the govt department to get licenses for importing. So we are back to license raj era ?

It‚Äôs confusing why some decisions are taken suddenly and goes into effect immediate ly. Does it send out wrong signals to companies operating in India? I think it does..
8/4/23, 17:56 - +91 79790 79505: It's not clothes, that can be illegally migrated from Bangladesh, Chinese products have very strict laws because of Indo China issues
8/4/23, 17:56 - +91 88103 86510: Before banning, the govt should try to establish some working laptops industry
8/4/23, 17:57 - +91 88103 86510: But all Indian govt does is ban x ban y, increase tax on z , but don't actually promote anything useful
8/4/23, 17:58 - +91 79790 79505: They did a similar thing with apple few years back,

Forcing apple to put their industry in India for assembly,

We have a great FP right now.
8/4/23, 17:59 - +91 90031 35354: Exactly
8/4/23, 18:00 - +91 90031 35354: Ha ha yes üòÖ it's a passing game always
8/4/23, 18:01 - +91 79790 79505: Thankfully TikTok got banned, otherwise we would be facing the same issues as US facing today
8/4/23, 18:01 - +91 88103 86510: Lol no, govt can't force apple, apple put industry for assembly because there is demand for Apple products in india, so it was profitable for them to assemble here
8/4/23, 18:01 - +91 88103 86510: Also, apple is still USA company, their profits go to USA, so making them establish assembly doesn't mean it's Indian industry
8/4/23, 18:02 - +91 79790 79505: Check once,
Apple put it, because the gov forced that if you are selling in India, you got to provide jobs.
8/4/23, 18:02 - +91 79790 79505: Jobs.
Not industry, Jobs.
8/4/23, 18:05 - +91 70160 21782: I still think there will still be a *short term* collateral damage on students, online gamers and crypto miners due to restriction on seven categories under HSN 8471. Also service industry will bear the brunt.
8/4/23, 18:06 - +91 90031 35354: Yes that's true, but the manufacturing should be done completely here instead of assembling, only then the Indian customers and Indian manufacturing workers and engineers can get benefitted. What say ?
8/4/23, 18:06 - +91 90031 35354: That will be for next 6 months I guess not more than that
8/4/23, 18:07 - +91 70160 21782: Hopefully
8/4/23, 18:11 - +91 88103 86510: Exactly, and not every industrial problem can be solved by just increasing taxes or banning random things, they should think more long term
8/4/23, 18:11 - +91 88103 86510: How many jobs are they providing? 1 lakh?
8/4/23, 18:13 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: This is just a signal that there is no clear strategy for growth. Just a last minute manipulation to prepare for next elections..They look at what they want and make one shot moves to get to their objectives.
8/4/23, 18:15 - +91 90031 35354: Yes but 100% true
8/4/23, 18:24 - +91 88103 86510: Exactly
8/4/23, 18:25 - +91 88103 86510: All these are short term diversions to distract people from actual topics

2. How it affects me in next 1-2 years at least
8/5/23, 00:00 - +91 88103 86510: if its real, it will change world as we know it
8/5/23, 00:01 - +91 88103 86510: friction-less transport like hoverboards, levitating vehicles and trains are just some of infinite usages of it
8/5/23, 00:02 - +91 92050 66063: Sounds good. But sounds like we'll see its impact in next 4-6 years in everyday life <This message was edited>
8/5/23, 00:02 - +91 88103 86510: just waiting for either it being debunked or proven real. it may take 1-2 weeks approx for more clarity
8/5/23, 00:03 - +91 88103 86510: nope. it may start having impacts in computing within 1-2 years or even earlier, looking at how the progress is with AI.
8/5/23, 00:05 - +91 92050 66063: Curious how it turns out.

8/5/23, 21:31 - +91 72474 89270: Tables inside the PDF?
8/5/23, 21:34 - +91 90031 35354: You can work on extracting those tables from PDFs using some packages like Camerlot or Tabula or even Tika and then create Embeddings for them, this might help

8/5/23, 21:50 - +91 72474 89270: Most of the pdf parsers just extract text of the table
8/5/23, 21:51 - +91 72474 89270: Even mix up multiple tables

8/5/23, 21:52 - +91 72474 89270: These are small tables if you pass them as CSV or markdown format
8/5/23, 21:52 - +91 72474 89270: LLM would handle it properly

8/5/23, 22:22 - +91 72474 89270: You don't pass embedding to your LLM
8/5/23, 22:22 - +91 72474 89270: You pass the chunks to the LLm
8/5/23, 22:23 - +91 72474 89270: Embeddings are only used for retrieving the relevant chunk

For large tabular data, I would love to hear morr about existing solutions to get accurately process and retrieve data
8/5/23, 23:03 - +91 72474 89270: Langchain has an example that uses pandas to execute code and compute results
8/5/23, 23:06 - +91 92050 66063: Interesting will checkout
8/5/23, 23:08 - +91 72474 89270: A word of caution though, you need a pretty safe sandbox to execute arbitrary GPT generated python code

8/5/23, 23:27 - +91 82090 10128: Hi Friends, Here's the Episode 6 of exploring minds.

We are constantly trying to improve and experiment, would love to know your honest feedback about it :) 

Feel free to reachout if you have suggestions, we have already shooted 25 episodes, tune in in for new releases every Friday!
8/5/23, 23:27 - +91 82090 10128: Everytime you sit on a plane or visit some hotel or drive a luxury car, most likely you are triggering a software made by his company, Nagarro which is a billion dollar revenue company listed in Frankfurt Stock Exchange, He is an alumnus of Stanford, Harvard and IIT Delhi. Do like and comment if you like the episode, this is going to be slow but super insightful.
8/6/23, 00:09 - +1 (862) 754-4963: Langchain works on csv files but I'm not sure about tables in pdf
8/6/23, 03:21 - +229 97 76 43 76: Hello
I‚Äôm looking for someone very familiar with Firebase+FlutterFlow+LangChain <This message was edited>
8/6/23, 11:13 - +91 98104 85533: we are in the process of creating an opensource SDK that does this and release it for free. if you have some example data/example queries , please send that on dm. will try to incorporate that as a valid usecase.
8/6/23, 18:30 - +1 (647) 877-9224: lol let me tell you I spent 2 weeks trying to figure out how to read tables and charts in pdf files. Tried Camelot script, tabula script, tried to hack it through prompt engineering and it worked but very inconsistently. Ended up having to convert to text myself. One possible solution might be to add OCR functionality in your project.
8/6/23, 18:33 - +91 81044 28406: what text stack?
8/6/23, 18:33 - +91 81044 28406: tech
8/6/23, 18:35 - +1 (647) 877-9224: Hey fellow ai enthusiasts and professionals , I wanted to share something with all of you. It is a story called byte shells: guardians of the data valley. It‚Äôs a twist on ninja turtles, except that in this story it is about autonomous agents that have the potential to create agi, only if they can learn to work together in perfect harmony. https://open.spotify.com/show/0LfNZKnjhutkqLjPKpmDpA

It would mean a lot if you liked and shared. Enjoy ^_^
8/6/23, 18:37 - +1 (647) 877-9224: LangChain, Pinecone, Typescript, Openai, and Next.js.
8/6/23, 18:43 - +1 (862) 754-4963: Yup using form recognizer for now, when I'm chunking the pdf I'm not sending chunk to gpt instead I'm sending the page where Chunk is matched, we can improve this by sending 1 page before and after, my assumption here text surrounding the table will have some connection to the table thus it will match
8/6/23, 19:28 - +1 (647) 877-9224: Based on your tests does this work in accurately interpreting the tables data in pdf files ?
8/6/23, 19:33 - +91 73877 90163: Can Anyone Recommend Good Well Structured & Comprehensive Course For Prompt Engineering (Doesn't Matter It's Free Or Not) I Am Ready To Pay If It Have Quality.
8/6/23, 19:36 - +91 73877 90163: I Am Now Planned To Learn Prompting. Riley Who Is Working At Scale Have An Exceptional Prompting Skills. So I Am Now Curious To Learn
8/6/23, 19:36 - +91 81044 28406: andrew Ng's is a good starting point, it helps in my day to day plus it's like 1-2hr for the entire thing so
8/6/23, 19:37 - +91 73877 90163: Yeah I Heard About That One, Any More Recommendations? That Will Deep Dive Into Prompt Engineering.
8/6/23, 19:37 - +91 73877 90163: Not Gonna Lie I Got To Learn So Much From Riley. And I Am Now Curious To Learn It More
8/6/23, 19:43 - +91 63695 89236: thanks for sharing. his videos are good. please share if you find resources i am also very interested
8/6/23, 19:45 - +91 73877 90163: Yes Also Follow Him On Twitter. He Really Post Good Content There.
8/6/23, 19:54 - +1 (862) 754-4963: Form recognizer is doing half the work and yes based on my limited testing I would say it's working
8/6/23, 22:51 - +91 96119 30033: The free version of this guide is useful https://www.promptingguide.ai/

Prompt engineering is not a definite, all there is are techniques and you have to discover what works best for your use case

8/7/23, 11:06 - +91 79790 79505: Although tbh, courses aren't possible for founders due to time limitations, I guess, mentorship is mostly favourable now a days
8/7/23, 11:07 - +91 79790 79505: Also, this is personal opinion, so not generalising it
8/7/23, 11:09 - +91 98882 00891: I build a bot using no code tools ( stack and bot press ) and connect it to WhatsApp.

I trained it with one YouTube channel transcriptions.

What limitations do no-code bots have in comparison too custom made ? <This message was edited>

8/7/23, 11:12 - +91 99100 82369: Hey very cool Manoj. Are there any tutorials you used to do this?
8/7/23, 11:22 - +91 98882 00891: There are very few and I like one channel and created a bot of that channel for personalised advice and i am texting with it on WhatsApp and it is going good so far
8/7/23, 11:22 - +91 98882 00891: Liam Ottley
8/7/23, 11:23 - +91 98882 00891: Which option is more cost effective ( No-code or Custom) ?
8/7/23, 11:33 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: If it‚Äôs a hobby project it‚Äôs ok but you cannot use YouTube data to train models.. YouTube transcriptions are proprietary data.. nice idea anyways üòè
8/7/23, 11:34 - +91 98882 00891: Yeah true but it is good for creating personalised advice which is not possible with YouTube video
8/7/23, 11:35 - +91 98882 00891: I am a member of his community and he  taught to build this bot
8/7/23, 11:35 - +91 98882 00891: I am looking to create such bot for my client . I am worried about running cost of this bot to owners
8/7/23, 11:37 - +91 73877 90163: Thanks.

Anyone In Mumbai Up For This? Let's Meet. üôå
8/7/23, 12:17 - +91 90290 81083: Isn't it publicly available data and not proprietary hence.... A bit like stock prices or newspaper articles?
8/7/23, 12:21 - +91 88103 86510: Who cares, all AI companies are using public data without issues. OpenAI used paid books without any consent
8/7/23, 12:21 - +91 88103 86510: How else do you think they got 10T tokens data?
8/7/23, 12:45 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Customizations: 
Majority of the clients require the responses to be customized based on their needs. 
Some need it more descriptive, Some very concise, Some want to include action items, and some require additional information along with answers etc etc
We cannot provide those adjustments just via prompt - U need to alter parameters and apply summarization techniques/metaData retrieval/Custom agents etc. 

Also u reduce the recurring cost by not integrating 3rd party. 
Ai Projects already have plenty of 3rd party costs.

8/7/23, 20:54 - +91 95388 11722: you need a cotour server to get the connected.
8/7/23, 20:54 - +91 95388 11722: i.e. turn server

8/16/23, 01:08 - +91 99606 43970: Nah
8/16/23, 01:08 - +91 99606 43970: It doesn't
8/16/23, 01:08 - +91 99606 43970: Just new year streamlit
8/16/23, 01:08 - +91 99606 43970: It makes life so much easier than flask
8/16/23, 01:09 - +91 99606 43970: But still trying to figure out how to make it look professional
8/16/23, 01:10 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Any tips/Suggestion on "How can we scale/optimize a AI chatbot to handle 400 users on production?"
Throughput : 5 users/sec
Backend : Langchain+chroma DB.
Frontend: Simple streamlit UI.
8/16/23, 01:10 - +91 99606 43970: Can you share your UI
8/16/23, 01:10 - +91 99606 43970: Mine is looking ugly as hell and I need inspiration.
8/16/23, 01:11 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Not yet built. I am currently in planning stage
8/16/23, 01:12 - +91 99606 43970: @917247489270 maybe you have done ideas üòú
8/16/23, 01:12 - +91 99606 43970: All the best
8/16/23, 01:12 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): most probably will be something similar to this
https://llama2demo.streamlit.app/
8/16/23, 01:13 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): UI is not the concern, I can keep it very simple/vasic
8/16/23, 01:13 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): sustaining the load is the concern
8/16/23, 01:13 - +91 72474 89270: Wow the UI looks pretty neat to me
8/16/23, 01:17 - +91 99606 43970: Where would you be hosting and what are you doing for caching and load balancing
8/16/23, 01:18 - +91 72474 89270: The model is on replicate
8/16/23, 01:19 - +91 72474 89270: So they don't have to worry about scaling the model
8/16/23, 01:20 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): AWS EC2 instances. 
How will caching be useful in our case. Like responses and questions would be different. I'm just wondering, will it be useful. Haven't yet worked on this scale
8/16/23, 01:20 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Earlier- used AWS lightsails to host the small projects
8/16/23, 01:20 - +91 72474 89270: Some people add a really fast intent classifier for caching common questions
8/16/23, 01:21 - +91 72474 89270: I see a lot of hey hello messages when analysing user data
8/16/23, 01:21 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): oh, got it.
8/16/23, 01:22 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): that's right- usual questions would be repetitive.
8/16/23, 01:22 - +91 72474 89270: https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-elastic-beanstalk/
8/16/23, 01:22 - +91 72474 89270: This may help you

8/16/23, 01:25 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Thanks üíô
8/16/23, 01:29 - +91 99606 43970: What do you guys do to reduce time for creation of embedding
8/16/23, 01:31 - +91 72474 89270: Run it in parallel
8/16/23, 01:36 - +91 72474 89270: https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT
8/16/23, 01:37 - +91 72474 89270: Gist of the project: A group of GPT agents with different roles perform better than a single agent
8/16/23, 01:48 - +91 72474 89270: We are using custom code for chunking and segmenting the documents, but this is what I did, instead of iterating through each chunk of data and calling OpenAI for creating embedding of it
8/16/23, 01:48 - +91 72474 89270: I send 5-10 requests at once
8/16/23, 01:50 - +91 72474 89270: If you are using an opensource model, host it on replicate and make multiple requests at once, obviously with a semaphore
8/16/23, 01:52 - +91 72474 89270: If you are running the embedding model in your own servers you are constrained by the CPU limit, so go with a VPS with multiple cores
8/16/23, 03:21 - +91 96181 27848: Ray distributed
8/16/23, 12:18 - +91 84148 94286: I have been running runpod serverless for stable diffusion and llama2 and been pleased with the results so far. For llama, the cold boot is around 10 secs and then subsequent calls are less than few seconds. 

If you are usin openAI , I might suggest to create AWS lambda function. It scales pretty well.
8/16/23, 12:22 - +91 88103 86510: What is average costing?
8/16/23, 12:23 - +91 84148 94286: 0.0005 per sec
8/16/23, 12:23 - +91 88103 86510: So approx how long it takes for a llama2 call?
8/16/23, 12:23 - +91 88103 86510: I mean cost per message
8/16/23, 12:24 - +91 7397 360 520: Nice, Valuable info :)
8/16/23, 12:24 - +91 84148 94286: Less than 1 sec llama2 call, the cold boot is 10 seconds.
8/16/23, 12:25 - +91 88103 86510: Nice, so basically 0.0005 per msg?
8/16/23, 12:26 - +91 84148 94286: 0.003 - 0.005 per single call. We usually do batch calls with multiple workers so it‚Äôs much less time and the load is distributed. 

It also depends on the GPU type.
8/16/23, 12:26 - +91 84148 94286: We use 4090 mostly but honestly it works just fine with any other.
8/16/23, 12:27 - +91 84148 94286: 0.005 per message accounting cold boot. Around 10 seconds for first message generation, subsequent calls are less than a second
8/16/23, 12:28 - +91 88103 86510: I see
8/16/23, 12:36 - +91 63695 89236: @919558333464 for info
8/16/23, 13:24 - +91 99581 49544: Hi

8/16/23, 13:41 - +91 72474 89270: Not opensource
8/16/23, 13:41 - +91 72474 89270: But you can get some idea by using it
8/16/23, 13:42 - +44 7404 656243: wow this is a great idea üî•
8/16/23, 13:42 - +91 72474 89270: Tried doing it a while back
8/16/23, 13:42 - +91 98104 85533: How do u setup runpod serverless for Llama2 ? I'm looking to use it and couldn't figure out how to set it up for low cost running
8/16/23, 13:43 - +91 72474 89270: But alignment turned out to be quite hard

Bring your own container
8/16/23, 13:44 - +91 84148 94286: I followed this tut:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftb4vbGUr7U
8/16/23, 13:44 - +91 98104 85533: Sorry a little beginner at this. Is there a readymade Llama2 container available that we can use in this way ? Or we have to hand create one ?
8/16/23, 13:45 - +91 84148 94286: I modifed the docker for my use, but the given container runs smoothly.
8/16/23, 13:47 - +44 7404 656243: alignment of text? - should be straightforward no some canvas based solution/ fabricjs maybe
8/16/23, 13:48 - +44 7404 656243: https://docs.runpod.io/reference/llama2-13b-chat
8/16/23, 13:50 - +91 72474 89270: Maybe it's my OCD, even with canvas template when people paste their content in it, and move things around I feel like the alignment and design are messed up
8/16/23, 13:50 - +91 84148 94286: That‚Äôs the official version of llama. If you use container and use your network volume, you can host any hf model as serverless endpoint.
8/16/23, 13:50 - +91 72474 89270: So if I started with a perfectly aligned template
8/16/23, 13:50 - +91 63695 89236: i had the same idea but couldnt execute
8/16/23, 13:50 - +91 72474 89270: And LLM added text on top of ir
8/16/23, 13:51 - +91 72474 89270: It messed up the alignments
8/16/23, 13:51 - +91 72474 89270: Simple rules like font size  adjustment and moving text around helps but wasn't satisfactory
8/16/23, 13:52 - +91 63695 89236: yeah that sort of things takes time to perfect. but possible
8/16/23, 13:52 - +91 72474 89270: üíØ
8/16/23, 13:52 - +91 72474 89270: Then I refactored the code into something completely different üòÇüòÇ
8/16/23, 13:53 - +91 72474 89270: It's even more cool, I'll show it here some day
8/16/23, 13:53 - +91 63695 89236: question is how to make the background and the images
8/16/23, 13:53 - +44 7404 656243: üôÑI wonder how many of us do this (and just dont launch)
8/16/23, 13:53 - +91 72474 89270: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
8/16/23, 13:53 - +91 63695 89236: is definitely not an easy problem and needs domain expertise. but high value market
8/16/23, 13:53 - +44 7404 656243: to begin with you dont need images as background - just gradients etc..
8/16/23, 13:54 - +91 72474 89270: Yeah we should have a separate group
8/16/23, 13:54 - +91 72474 89270: For peer support
8/16/23, 13:54 - +91 72474 89270: And motivation

8/16/23, 19:18 - +1 (818) 620-8536: Docker + serverless on cloudfare
8/16/23, 19:25 - +91 99606 43970: that's great
8/16/23, 20:05 - +91 63695 89236: I think the issue is not with users scaling it's with OpenAI rate limits
8/16/23, 20:07 - +91 63695 89236: Azure openai will help
8/16/23, 20:09 - +91 90215 66239: Yes, this is correct. I faced the same issue with GPT4 where I only had 3k TPM. You are quickly going to run into issues when number of users increase. 

It's better to increase user access gradually then directly releasing the bot to 400 users where it might crash.
8/16/23, 21:57 - +91 63794 73054: https://github.com/Abinesh-Mathivanan/gpt_integration
8/16/23, 22:18 - +91 90052 36891: Azure openai is also not reliable we also tested it many times the api returned error
8/16/23, 22:20 - +91 89290 90206: You can fill a form and increase your rate limits
8/16/23, 22:20 - +91 89290 90206: It is there on Open AI's website
8/16/23, 22:20 - +91 89290 90206: They will allow if the usage on your organization ID is above a certain limit
8/16/23, 22:21 - +91 63695 89236: Did that work out for u
8/16/23, 22:21 - +91 89290 90206: Else host a llama2 on serverless and use it instead of anyways overpriced Open AI API <This message was edited>
8/16/23, 22:21 - +91 89290 90206: We are yet to launch our first GPT based product. But as per Reddit users, it works well
8/16/23, 22:47 - +91 63695 89236: What's your monthly cost for that
8/16/23, 22:51 - +91 89290 90206: A100 machine runs for 1,40,000 INR per month on runpod. 

For serverless, it is per second basis. 

Comes down to 3.2 INR per minute. Or 0.5 INR per execution.
8/16/23, 22:51 - +91 89290 90206: GPT 3 API is 1.5 INR per execution
8/16/23, 22:51 - +91 89290 90206: GPT 4 is at 40 INR plus
8/16/23, 22:51 - +91 89290 90206: For max tokens
8/16/23, 22:51 - +91 89290 90206: So definitely lots of price savings in hosting vs API
8/16/23, 23:00 - +91 63695 89236: Noted thanks for the valuable insights
8/16/23, 23:00 - +91 63695 89236: What data set you train on
8/16/23, 23:01 - +91 89290 90206: We have a small 3-4 member team working on GPT products. Rest is all 3D, images and videos

8/19/23, 09:49 - +91 90290 81083: That's what I've also seen... RAG works in most cases
8/19/23, 09:51 - +91 90290 81083: Maybe if you're building for a specific domain like medical, law etc... May help with fine tuning since there is larger context needed than what's possible via RAG ... Though LLMOPs is pretty difficult
8/19/23, 09:52 - +91 72474 89270: Exactly
8/19/23, 09:52 - +91 72474 89270: Some big investment firms have fine tuned financial models
8/19/23, 10:50 - +44 7404 656243: Fine tuning can be costly and can get out of date quickly (depending on use case) and then you might have to fine tune often.
8/19/23, 11:34 - +91 7397 360 520: Interesting insight

8/19/23, 11:38 - +91 72474 89270: Scientific journals was one of them, so they fine tuned on this
8/19/23, 11:38 - +91 72474 89270: I have also seen it giving very generic answers for SAP related questions
8/19/23, 11:44 - +44 7404 656243: Did embesdings and rag not work for you?
8/19/23, 11:44 - +91 72474 89270: SAP is quite big and complex simple retrieval based methods fail on it
8/19/23, 11:46 - +91 72474 89270: The same goes for scientific journals, the notations and vocabulary being used is very hard for GPT to work for, I saw this paper where they compared it against 3.5
8/19/23, 11:47 - +1 (669) 388-1083: Sometimes only RAGs don't work. We also need to add keyword search and not just semantics. This can be achieved with something like bm25

8/21/23, 13:15 - +91 91984 58986: Hey everyone, new to AI/ML. What platforms generally do you prefer to use a model (like whisper) and expose as a service? Does it scale well? I mean like multiple requests to the service, are they served in parallel or blocking?
8/21/23, 13:17 - +91 91132 06642: Hey guys, I'm using chatgpt APIs. Is there a way to use 3rd party plugins with the APIs in my code?
8/21/23, 13:36 - +91 86191 15677: Personally I just wrote a quick node js wrapper around it and expose it as APIs.
8/21/23, 13:42 - +91 90290 81083: You hit quota but not rate limit?

8/21/23, 17:50 - +91 83769 13427: Anyone here good at prompt engineering GPT-3.5 / ChatGPT?
I have an interesting problem i want to solve.
Given a webpage, I want the LLM to generate the probable search queries a user would type out on Google in order to find it.

For example:
Say the webpage is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad
The search queries would be: "bryan cranston show", "vince gilligan", "crime/drug shows",

I want to prompt the LLM such that given the webpage, it generates some probable search queries. I have a working concept but I have some more tuning. 

Anyone willing to help out here? :D
8/21/23, 18:09 - +91 96329 48088: Hey everyone,

8/21/23, 18:16 - +91 99100 82369: A very interesting use case.
8/21/23, 18:35 - +91 83769 13427: yes, i was able to get it to work fairly well but i feel there's more to be desired.
8/21/23, 18:36 - +91 83769 13427: it could also be just due to me using gpt-3.5-turbo thoug
8/21/23, 18:55 - +91 63695 89236: That's easy. Learn the basics of prompt engineering
8/21/23, 18:56 - +91 63695 89236: Then create the first version. I'll help to iterate.
8/21/23, 21:25 - +44 7404 656243: Hey I think a bunch of you have done translating videos on multiple langgaues.. Which tts do you recommend? Which is the most natural sounding and can give me different languages in same voice?
8/21/23, 21:26 - +44 7404 656243: Or is there any audio to audio model out there?
8/21/23, 21:27 - +91 72474 89270: https://elevenlabs.io/
8/21/23, 21:27 - +91 72474 89270: Tried this one?
8/21/23, 21:27 - +91 72474 89270: There is also an open one, lemme find it
8/21/23, 21:33 - +91 88103 86510: bark is very natural sounding. recently audicraft released by meta is awesome too
8/21/23, 21:38 - +91 83769 13427: I have a basic version using few shot prompting. I get acceptable results though.
8/21/23, 21:47 - +44 7404 656243: Heard of it and tried it briefly. I'll test out out lmk the open source one was it bark?
8/21/23, 22:10 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): there's bark and tortoise-tts.
My usecase was voice-cloning & tts.
Bark does not have voice cloning ig and tortoise-tts did not provide satisfactory results for voice cloning. 

So at the end moved on with play.HT.
Descript was also a decent option for TTS .
8/21/23, 22:13 - +91 72474 89270: https://nonint.com/static/tortoise_v2_examples.html
8/21/23, 22:15 - +91 72474 89270: These examples are way too good, also have prompting features for describing tone mood or background noise
8/21/23, 22:18 - +44 7404 656243: I do not want voice cloning.. Ideally just looking for same pre trained voice in different languages. Will try out a few tonight and let you know how it goes

8/21/23, 22:58 - +91 85279 05787: Hi guys, any way I can use a relational database (of lakh entry) with langchain?
8/21/23, 23:00 - +91 72474 89270: What's your use case? Either you want to feed the data of some fields to LLMs
8/21/23, 23:00 - +91 72474 89270: Or you want to query it using natural language
8/21/23, 23:00 - +91 72474 89270: Or a mix of both, first filter it then feed that filtered data into LLM
8/21/23, 23:01 - +91 98104 85533: edgechains support complex usecases with postgres/pgvector .

https://github.com/arakoodev/EdgeChains/tree/main/Examples/supabase-miniLM
8/21/23, 23:02 - +91 85279 05787: Yes it's like research papers and then want to query them
In beginning, even if I get part of each entry as return, it will be fine. Something like, only title and abstract based on semantic query
8/21/23, 23:03 - +91 85279 05787: Okay, would see, thanks
8/21/23, 23:05 - +91 85279 05787: I don't want to convert it into vector db for now
8/21/23, 23:05 - +91 85279 05787: Just something for a proof of concept
8/21/23, 23:10 - +91 72474 89270: @918527905787 you are not defining your problem or use case very properly, DB+LLM is a very broad topic
8/21/23, 23:15 - +44 7404 656243: You can use pgvector 
Chunck up  the paper and convert into embeddings... Save it in postgres and then you can use pgvector for similarity search. There should be lots of examples.
https://supabase.com/blog/chatgpt-supabase-docs
8/21/23, 23:16 - +44 7404 656243: Someone in the group also mentioned that rag does not work very well with special cases like research papers.. And suggested fine tuning. You can try and let us know how it went
8/21/23, 23:27 - +91 85279 05787: Yeah it's just I don't know how the database looks like since I haven't been shown
Just shared in a meeting that we have this
Will back with more detail on this, thanks for the help üòä
8/21/23, 23:29 - +91 98104 85533: We get this question frequently on edgechains. What most people are looking is infrastructure-first. SDK-second.

They would like to have usecases where they can join/sort embeddings data with their db data. 

Langchain is super challenged in this.
8/21/23, 23:29 - +91 85279 05787: I was told that the relational database has lakhs of papers
Each entry is the paper itself
We want to somehow do semantic search on it
8/21/23, 23:29 - +91 85279 05787: Now I think it's going to be a challenging thing
8/21/23, 23:30 - +91 85279 05787: But will see the database first üòÖ
8/21/23, 23:52 - +91 72474 89270: You don't necessarily need a vector db, if you are just looking for a PoC, ask ChatGPT to generate a list of keywords based on user's input, search on those keywords, paste the user's query and papers data back to GPT
8/21/23, 23:52 - +91 72474 89270: And It'll give you the answer
8/22/23, 02:11 - +1 (862) 754-4963: Fine-tuning, especially for research papers, might not be the most optimal approach. Given the consistent influx of new papers, it's impractical to fine-tune a model daily. RAG is likely a more effective solution in this context. While fine-tuning doesn't typically extract direct quotes from papers, users often seek exact content or statements from research articles. Using RAG offers the advantage of pulling specific information directly from the source. Although chunking the data for RAG can pose challenges, the structured sections in research papers can help this process.
8/22/23, 02:12 - +1 (862) 754-4963: And to add this while doing RAG the embedding model plays a crucial part so I suggest using OPEN AI for initial testing and may be in future train your own
8/22/23, 02:12 - +44 7404 656243: Azure open ai already is giving access to gpt-4-32k so might not even have to chunk the papers
8/22/23, 02:12 - +91 72474 89270: Fine tuning is not done to add new data, it is done when you need new domain, vocabulary and skills
8/22/23, 02:13 - +91 72474 89270: Afterall ChatGPT is a fine tuned LLM
8/22/23, 02:13 - +1 (862) 754-4963: yeah
8/22/23, 02:14 - +1 (862) 754-4963: The problem with LLM's with larger context imo is they loose attention at somepoint, but this is my opinion can someone add to this?
8/22/23, 02:15 - +44 7404 656243: I can test it out if someone wants to experiment üëÜI have 32k access
8/22/23, 02:15 - +1 (862) 754-4963: so it should be hybrid approach no? Fine tune and do RAG?
8/22/23, 02:16 - +91 72474 89270: Yeah retrieval and fine tuning works at just very different levels
8/22/23, 02:16 - +1 (862) 754-4963: Can we also fine tune embedding models?
8/22/23, 02:16 - +91 72474 89270: I guess do retrieval, do agent style retrieval in a while look, then only go for fine tuning
8/22/23, 02:17 - +91 72474 89270: Yeah sure you can
8/22/23, 02:17 - +1 (862) 754-4963: Then fine tune your embedding models to retrieve better context for llm
8/22/23, 02:17 - +91 72474 89270: There are various variants of embedding functions
8/22/23, 02:18 - +91 72474 89270: All these methods have their cost and reward, use the right method for right use case
8/22/23, 02:18 - +91 72474 89270: https://ai.meta.com/blog/imagebind-six-modalities-binding-ai/
8/22/23, 02:19 - +91 72474 89270: Here embedding to retrieve image, sound etc. Given the text
8/22/23, 02:21 - +91 72474 89270: https://minigpt-4.github.io/
8/22/23, 02:21 - +91 72474 89270: This one is also interesting
8/22/23, 02:21 - +1 (862) 754-4963: oh wow
8/22/23, 02:21 - +91 72474 89270: Here they have connected an LLM with ViT
8/22/23, 02:22 - +91 72474 89270: Terms get a bit messy now üòÇüòÇ it's hard to say that LLM is being fine tuned
8/22/23, 02:22 - +91 72474 89270: But anyways it's not RAG
8/22/23, 02:23 - +91 72474 89270: So keep experimenting and find what works best for your business
8/22/23, 02:23 - +91 72474 89270: Don't get into propaganda of pinecone who wants more business out of AI rush
8/22/23, 02:24 - +1 (862) 754-4963: while we are, I'm building code interpreter using gpt4, I'm able to create function to run python code but how so I upload files and let llm know it needs to answer from the document uploaded?
8/22/23, 02:24 - +91 72474 89270: RAG üò≠üò≠
8/22/23, 02:24 - +91 72474 89270: Search for an embedding model
8/22/23, 02:24 - +91 72474 89270: Specific for code
8/22/23, 02:25 - +1 (862) 754-4963: I mean just like how code interpreter works in CHATGPT
8/22/23, 02:25 - +1 (862) 754-4963: Did you get a chance to see it?
8/22/23, 02:26 - +1 (862) 754-4963: User can upload files and start asking questions right, I want to replicate that with Function calling
8/22/23, 02:27 - +91 72474 89270: Nope
8/22/23, 02:28 - +91 72474 89270: Haven't tried it
8/22/23, 02:28 - +1 (862) 754-4963: You should check it out it's does some cool stuff
8/22/23, 03:37 - +44 7404 656243: Something like this: https://github.com/shroominic/codeinterpreter-api

8/22/23, 03:38 - +44 7404 656243: I went with elevenlabs - thanks folks üëå
8/22/23, 03:47 - +91 72474 89270: If are going to try multiple tools let us know the comparison
8/22/23, 03:47 - +91 72474 89270: You are**
8/22/23, 03:48 - +44 7404 656243: I tried play.ht -> but it does not give me same voice actor in different languages. I could not find any other tool which did that. tbh I did not look after I tried elevenlabs
8/22/23, 04:03 - +91 72474 89270: I get the same feedback about elevenlabs
8/22/23, 08:29 - +91 98104 85533: i have seen multiple production grade RAG go live on edgechains (https://github.com/arakoodev/EdgeChains/tree/main/Examples/supabase-miniLM) for banks . internal credit, legal and policy documents semantic search. 

works brilliantly. we dont need finetuning for this - ur not exploring everything that embedding/chunking/cosine matches can give you.
8/22/23, 08:41 - +1 (669) 388-1083: Thanks for sharing. Can u share a bit more regarding cosine matches? As per the literature, llms can answer accurately as long as they have the entire context. So for semantic search we sometimes can miss some parts.
8/22/23, 08:58 - +91 98104 85533: First of all - "entire context" is not a viable strategy in this space. That is why "embedding" is used. Otherwise u could just send it entire documents.

What everyone has made successful is without full context (or full document) and that is really the engineering here.

Edgechains was built cos some of these strategies are not available in other frameworks
8/22/23, 08:58 - +91 98104 85533: For e.g. - one is u fetch the parent paragraph after u get a hit on the embedding match and use that to ask questions.
8/22/23, 08:59 - +91 98104 85533: Second (and my favorite) is the HyDE algorithm for matches. This is slower (cos it does two queries) but is very accurate.
8/22/23, 09:03 - +1 (669) 388-1083: Thanks for sharing üôÇ
8/22/23, 11:22 - +91 63695 89236: Thanks. I'm going to try it out. Have you compared it with the new parent child retriever method by langchain. I am interested to see how they compare for rag. Anyway I'll test and report back got delayed on it
8/22/23, 13:50 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Is this for a side project or a professional work ? I have extensively worked with tts and I have audio engineering background. The problem with eleven labs is that the voice is monotonic and there is no way to add emotions. It sounds good for a short while but in real applications it becomes a hinderance really quickly.
8/22/23, 13:51 - +44 7404 656243: It's a side project at the moment. Any solutions with emotions you can recommend?
8/22/23, 14:03 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: There is nothing out of the box. I have a custom api

---
import json

def convert_dataset(old_filepath, new_filepath, system_message):
    with open(old_filepath, 'r') as old_file, open(new_filepath, 'w') as new_file:
        for line in old_file:
            old_data = json.loads(line)
            new_data = {
                "messages": [
                    {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
                    {"role": "user", "content": old_data['prompt']},
                    {"role": "assistant", "content": old_data['completion']}
                ]
            }
            new_file.write(json.dumps(new_data) + '\n')

# Usage
system_message = "You are a helpful assistant."
convert_dataset('old_dataset.jsonl', 'new_dataset.jsonl', system_message)

8/23/23, 10:43 - +91 96202 12454: How do you extract information like name, phone number etc. from conversation with AI chatbot using LangChain? Are there any examples?
8/23/23, 10:59 - +91 90052 36891: You can actually use smaller language model like Bert
8/23/23, 12:28 - +91 88103 86510: Still waiting for access for search labs ü•≤ü•≤
8/23/23, 12:53 - +91 96807 99722: Using Kore can help
8/23/23, 12:56 - +91 96807 99722: KOR*
8/23/23, 13:18 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Exact question I have too.. from what I understand, it‚Äôs an alternative to few shot prompts but with fine tuning you will save on tokens in the input as few shot prompts are usually lengthy. For example in one of my previous project to a company I had to output multiple specific outputs by scanning some image and audio data. In each of the prompt I used to specify the exact output which made the prompt too big. Almost 50% of the prompt was to instruct how to output the model. With fine tuning if I train the exact output it must save up on my prompt length. 
Again this is my understanding of fine tuning
8/23/23, 13:43 - +91 70844 48444: Hi.
I just need some clarity on something ..
Like we are working with langchain and openai api and using prompt to make our work done. ..
In this we don't mention the database ...just the prompts and doing our work  or sometimes using our own database ...
Can we achieve the same with the help  of hugging face ..

If yes, then please share some resources

I am interested in both ai and data science...so which is better regarding the current situation of the tech field?
8/31/23, 21:42 - +91 72474 89270: Both are pretty wide fields @917994680767
8/31/23, 21:44 - +91 72474 89270: AI today is actually deep learning specifically LLMs and Diffusion based models
8/31/23, 21:46 - +91 72474 89270: AI is in a huge boom right now, but in terms of job, it's just LLMs and a lot of development efforts
8/31/23, 21:47 - +91 72474 89270: I have some frnds at Microsoft who have a lot of internal info on this
8/31/23, 21:47 - +91 72474 89270: According to them LLMs and AI are not like crypto or web3
8/31/23, 21:47 - +91 72474 89270: It's a huge platform shift

8/31/23, 21:53 - +91 72474 89270: Data science is a bit mature now
8/31/23, 21:54 - +91 72474 89270: You can study for specific fields and have well courses for it
8/31/23, 21:54 - +91 72474 89270: But AI is very new, I'm not sure what roles are there inside it
8/31/23, 21:54 - +91 72474 89270: What knowledge or course you have to do
8/31/23, 21:55 - +91 79946 80767: Hmm...ok

9/2/23, 22:58 - +91 72474 89270: Upload where?
9/2/23, 23:11 - +1 (780) 237-2506: To a local db ie. Pinecone.
9/2/23, 23:15 - +1 (780) 237-2506: I want to compare 2 PDFs essentially and have the LLM give me a result
9/2/23, 23:24 - +91 72474 89270: So you retrieve a specific section of each pdf from the pine cone
9/2/23, 23:25 - +91 72474 89270: And ask LLM to formulate a comparison?
9/2/23, 23:25 - +91 72474 89270: This is based on the user query
9/2/23, 23:25 - +91 72474 89270: Or you just want to compare the whole document from start to finish
9/2/23, 23:32 - +1 (780) 237-2506: User uploads 2 PDFs. 1 is a marking guide the other is a math assignment. Then the user receives a result which is the grade of the assignment
9/2/23, 23:32 - +1 (780) 237-2506: Thank u Atul. You a real one üôèüôèüôè
9/2/23, 23:34 - +91 72474 89270: You actually don't need a vector database for this
9/2/23, 23:35 - +91 72474 89270: But a lot of prompt engineering
9/2/23, 23:36 - +1 (780) 237-2506: Langchain?
9/2/23, 23:36 - +91 72474 89270: Langchain or directly call the API
9/2/23, 23:36 - +91 72474 89270: First input marking guide to LLM and ask LLM to prepare a json on question numbers and marking instructions
9/2/23, 23:37 - +91 72474 89270: Now from this json take all the question numbers, possibly the questions too, then feed the assignment with it(in chunks or whole)
9/2/23, 23:38 - +91 72474 89270: And ask LLM to assign retrieve/extract response of each question
9/2/23, 23:38 - +91 72474 89270: Now you have questions, making scheme and assignment response of each question
9/2/23, 23:38 - +91 72474 89270: LLM can easily do the grading
9/2/23, 23:39 - +91 72474 89270: So it's 3 step
9/2/23, 23:39 - +91 72474 89270: Based on how big each pdf is, you may need to do some chunking, but I highly doubt it. Assignments are usually pretty short
9/2/23, 23:43 - +1 (780) 237-2506: Thank u sir. I will use that to start
9/3/23, 13:16 - +91 90478 63124: Hey everyone! I'm looking for recommendations on low-cost serverless GPU providers to process real-time transcription from client to server using websocket. If WebSocket isn't suited for this use case, do you know of any alternative solutions? Also, when it comes to real-time transcription, what's the best way to choose a GPU? Should I opt for a serverless GPU and go with an on-demand option, taking into account cold start time to boot? Thanks in advance for your insights!
9/3/23, 15:03 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: I am speaking with experience here. If you want transcriptions to be real time it has to be on device to avoid user frustrations. The only advantage of going off device is if you are working on devices with limited processing power. Even raspberries can host transcription models nowadays.   Is there a reason you want to put it on a server ?

9/5/23, 17:12 - +91 85279 05787: Hi friends

I need some help, I have little coding experience only.

So I have created a gradio AI app using replit repl. So when I make it live, it gives me a link and says link will expire in 72 hours (I think gradio gives that link).

But the link stops working in 1 hour only and screen shows (no interface running).

I think it might be due to repl going down or shutting the server. Do you know what's the reason and what can I do, I want to keep my app hosted for at least 72 hours using the link?

Sorry for the long post

9/20/23, 07:55 - +91 63695 89236: Difference is throughput and availability nothing to do with code
9/20/23, 07:59 - +91 94952 90550: Ok, costwise any difference? Also do you suggest langchain as a good abstraction to deal with multiple LLM providers for production? ie if I use openai or azure openai through langchain it would make my code more flexible to adopt any new service that might come in future?
9/20/23, 07:59 - +91 63695 89236: Yep I do suggest it

9/24/23, 07:59 - +91 90031 35354: üî•Group Rules :üòé

1. What is the purpose of the group ?
*Group to come together and share knowledge via books. Actionable steps and learnings are the real bonus üòÄ*

2. What can be shared ?
*Insights from books, excerpts and summaries, audio books, podcasts.*

3. What cannot be 
shared ?
*Religious views, Racist comments and politics.*

4. What category of books are we covering ?
*Self help, Nutrition, Psychology, and Technical only. No Religion and Politics, which will only create heated debate.*

5. Also do we have any clear set of goals ?
*Track book reading and completion via Goodreads. 1 or 2 books a month ‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ*

10/1/23, 00:02 - +91 92058 51034: Well in the case which is a surprising outlier. I would suggest start learning bit by bit, I'll say to start 3blue1brown is a good place to start. Or you could search any topic on YouTube and Stanford Lectures are also good. Other than that you can ask your doubts in the group as well, I am sure everyone would love to help you.

Do we have any opportunities in Data engineer for now(2+ years of experience)?

I'm in notice now
10/1/23, 16:06 - +91 79950 39381: Hello AI folks. I am a student. Does any one know a text classification model which is open source and doesn't need training data ? Please share the details it would be a huge help
10/1/23, 16:15 - +44 7404 656243: You can try llama2 

Gpt-4 does a very good job with few shot prompts and I would expect llama2 to give you good results too
10/1/23, 16:16 - +91 79950 39381: Thank you so much. I will definitely try
10/1/23, 16:16 - +44 7404 656243: Why not use gpt4 @917995039381?
10/1/23, 16:19 - +91 79950 39381: Gpt 4 is not opensource yet. So I guess we need to pay for the subscription. So I am thinking to proceed with llama2
10/1/23, 16:22 - +91 72474 89270: You still need to pay for llama2 server cost right?
10/1/23, 16:27 - +91 90031 35354: Go for a Open Source Models like BART, T5, along with Zero/Few-Shot
10/1/23, 16:27 - +91 90031 35354: Why to even go for LLMs, it u can solve it at this level
10/1/23, 16:28 - +91 79950 39381: Is it ? I thought llama2 is free to deploy. Thank you i will recheck it.
10/1/23, 16:28 - +91 79950 39381: Yes. I am actually trying zero shot classification now.
10/1/23, 16:29 - +91 90031 35354: That's a good starting point
10/1/23, 16:29 - +91 90031 35354: Hi friends, Why are most companies and teams going for LLMs Blindly as the starting approach now a days ?
10/1/23, 16:31 - +91 72474 89270: You may be fine with some free tier or demo credits
10/1/23, 16:32 - +91 72474 89270: It outperforms older models with a huge margin
10/1/23, 16:33 - +91 72474 89270: Once you have it setup working in LLMs, you can fine tune some smaller model for cost optimization
10/1/23, 16:33 - +91 72474 89270: But still it's a good starting point
10/1/23, 16:34 - +91 90031 35354: Yes absolutely üòÄ
10/1/23, 16:35 - +91 90031 35354: But the question is again, is it needed for the client ?

10/1/23, 17:16 - +91 88585 06876: Do these models need training? How are these different from LLMs? Just curious üòÖ
10/1/23, 17:55 - +91 72474 89270: Zero shot, one shot and few shot models don't need training
10/1/23, 17:55 - +91 72474 89270: Others doo
10/1/23, 17:56 - +91 88585 06876: Thanks!
10/1/23, 18:24 - +91 90031 35354: Major difference is Zero/First/Few Shot models don't require much training and also they're much smaller in size than Large LMs (Where Large means min 1 Billion Parameters).

Most LMs (Language Models) like BERT, BART, T5 are still producing decent results and have been deployed to PROD (Production Environments) for various domains for 1000s of clients, while these LLMs don't go beyond POCs for the time being. Still a long way to go there.

Also, what are the NLP metrics to evaluate these LLM models ?
10/1/23, 18:53 - +91 88585 06876: Sounds great! Thanks for explaining. I am currently in the process of understanding these models with their differences and pros and cons. I believe the application of these models would depend on use cases. I wonder if there's a guideline for selecting the correct model based on factors like scalability, costs, performance, maturity of the product etc etc. It would be really helpful.

10/4/23, 11:26 - +91 88585 06876: Choosing a Foundation Model: A Summary

Modalities: Start by identifying the modalities your project requires, such as language, vision, or a "wild card" modality for unique tasks.

Generative Models: If your task is generative in nature, favor decoder-based auto-regressive models for better results.

Parameter Sizes: Select the appropriate model size based on the complexity of your task. Smaller models may suffice for simple tasks, while larger ones are better for complex tasks.

Accuracy Thresholds: Set accuracy thresholds to evaluate how well the model performs on your specific task.

Open Source vs. Proprietary: Choose between open source and proprietary models. Open source models offer flexibility and avoid vendor lock-in, while proprietary models offload some development work and may provide quicker access to high-performance models.

Working Examples: Start with a working example or a prototype that demonstrates the task you want to achieve. A working example is more compelling than a concept.

External Benchmarks: Familiarize yourself with external benchmarks, like those provided by Hugging Face or Stanford's Helm project, to evaluate model performance. However, develop your own unit tests and edge cases specific to your domain.

Model Updates: Plan for model updates and pipeline refreshes to stay current with evolving models and improvements in the field.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively choose the right foundation model for your project, ensuring that it aligns with your specific needs and performs optimally for your tasks.
10/4/23, 11:27 - +91 88585 06876: Experts! please let me know if I am missing something here, I have just started with my prototype and trying to figure out what is the best model for me...

1. MATLAB/Simulink models ? 
2. CAD models for hardware design?
10/5/23, 22:34 - +91 90031 35354: If u have the right dataset I think u could try to perform similar tasks but at the very basic level
10/5/23, 22:36 - +91 75300 04661: So either these companies are already working on it or there's a huge vacuum in this field. Until now I keep seeing only web based generative projects . <This message was edited>
10/5/23, 22:39 - +91 90031 35354: Arun bro it's very tough to match the level of the above models, as they've evolved over many years
10/5/23, 22:39 - +91 90031 35354: Web based Gen AI projects are the easiest to start with
10/5/23, 22:40 - +91 75300 04661: Oh ok.
10/6/23, 01:33 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: In CAD anyways the trend is to work on generative design rather than automated designs. Yes autodesk has python script integrated so it exists from some time. But would be fun to include gpt into fusion or something

10/9/23, 11:58 - +91 88585 06876: Hi all, quick question...
If i take a small foundation model for example a 40b model and train it with niche data, will it beat at 175b parameter model in that particular niche?
10/9/23, 12:44 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: I remember reading somewhere that the quality of LLMs does not really depend on the parameters but on the quality of training set used and verification processes.
Chatgpts success actually related to its reinforcement learning technics rather than the number of parameters.
There is an interview of Mira the cto of openai who explains this on YouTube have a look.
So to answer your question I think yes for your question.
10/9/23, 12:58 - +91 88585 06876: thanks for referring to the interview! really helpful

10/24/23, 13:47 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Hey all 
I have finally launched the website be-alloy.com in French market after 6 months of intensive developement. I am a solo developer.
Currently the orientation I have taken is to provide audio to audio translation service from French to any language. 
Specifically for marketing agencies and YouTubers to easily translate corporate videos or YouTube videos. 
Currently hey gen is a well known service but it doesn‚Äôt work when there are multiple speakers.
In terms of pricing I am positioned not as a subscription service but pay to use with fixed pricing per minute.
The core idea is to make it a easy tool so anyone can use it with no editor or crazy professional controllers. 
What do you think ? 
Can I get some help here if I launch on product hunt?
10/24/23, 16:19 - +91 90215 66239: Has anyone used llamaindex for their RAG pipelines? What has been your experience? I am planning to use it Azure Search. My use case has about 15-20gb of data per year.
10/24/23, 16:32 - +91 63695 89236: Didn't get much value from it
10/24/23, 16:32 - +91 63695 89236: Found 3 bugs in their docs. Overall a waste of my time but this was few moths ago
10/24/23, 16:33 - +91 63695 89236: But now must be different. I'm also wanting to be educated on rag via llamainx
10/24/23, 16:33 - +91 63695 89236: Their new youtube tutorials seem interesting
10/24/23, 16:34 - +91 90215 66239: Yep, true for starters. I struggled to get started as the code didn't fall back on defaults. Documentation isn't that great but they have improved a lot in last few weeks
10/24/23, 16:39 - +91 90290 81083: they're really upping their doc / tutorial game in the last couple of months since they got funded
10/24/23, 16:39 - +91 90290 81083: they had started to look at advanced RAG techniques much before Langchain
10/24/23, 16:40 - +91 63695 89236: Yeah
10/24/23, 16:40 - +91 63695 89236: But struggling to make it applicable

10/28/23, 23:14 - +91 99580 07011: Hey folks, I am looking for someone who can help me build a 3D generative model for cars (there are few new ones that have come up, like this https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DreamCraft3D)  Internet has a lot of vehicle (cars, 2wheelers) photos lying around and I was wondering if we can either finetune or train any of these generative models specifically for generating 3d models.

Has anyone worked on these 3d models before?
10/28/23, 23:16 - +91 99580 07011: The issue here is I've tried out a few of these tools but since they only take one reference image, they don't get the full view and generate something low quality. Luma AI and Polycam needs you to actually scan the entire thing in real life. If anyone has suggestions on how to do this I am happy to do a project based renumeration.
10/29/23, 02:01 - +91 82090 10128: Anyone in the valley near Stanford now? ü§†
10/29/23, 02:40 - +44 7404 656243: how about as a first step (or a lazy hack) create a pipeline of text -> image -> 3d using one of the recent image to 3d models? 
For example https://github.com/xxlong0/Wonder3D

ps: I have no clue at the moment if there are any 3d gen ai models / or if they are finetuneable. 
btw, what are you trying to achieve ?
10/29/23, 03:26 - +91 99580 07011: I am building https://chargespot.app and our UI uses 3d models of users vehicles to represent a lot of things. We have a 3D designer and we have created 3 vehicles ( a nexon ev, mg comet and Ola s1). Creating each vehicle 1-1.5 weeks and with the speed at which ev vehicles are coming out we won‚Äôt be able match up our speed with a deficit of so many already existing ev vehicles. 

There are a lot of reference high quality images available online though and I was thinking if we can use generative ai with some custom training we should be able to come close to a good enough model. The nitpicks can be fixed later on
10/29/23, 04:52 - +44 7404 656243: got it - yea so you could definitely try out image -> 3d models / or even Adobe has a tool for it  https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/substance3d/discover/pictures-to-3d-models.html
never used and you will probably need photos from a lot of different angles for this to work

this can give you a good starting point and the 3d designer can fix any shortcomings and take it to production
10/29/23, 12:49 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: D√©pends on what you want to do with the 3D

If it is for visual representation, then yes, there are a lot of models that you can look into but if you work if you want to work on the 3-D on a more precision basis, like find the dimensions and stuff, then it's more complicated use case to work on using images to 3-D

10/29/23, 13:01 - +91 90031 35354: You can also try out PyPDF2 and PdfPlumber to compare the results
10/29/23, 13:03 - +91 85279 05787: Thanks, will try this üòÉ
10/29/23, 13:03 - +91 90031 35354: 1. For extraction related to PDF -> use PyMuPDF

2. For extraction related to DOCX -> use  Python-Docx

This I'm saying from my experience of developing and deploying multiple projects bro üòÄ
10/29/23, 13:04 - +91 90031 35354: If u encounter .doc (headache format üòÇ) then there is a windows package to convert .doc to pdf then use PyMuPDF itself ü§©
10/29/23, 13:05 - +91 85279 05787: Great, thanks for this
Also did you ever work on extraction from excel files?
10/29/23, 13:05 - +91 85279 05787: Since that's a common format I get work on too

First it needs to convert doc to pdf/docx, then extract the content
10/29/23, 13:06 - +91 90031 35354: Excel should be fairly easy bro compared to pdf/doc/docx, but u need to define no of columns and headers properly
10/29/23, 13:06 - +91 85279 05787: That sounds useful too

10/29/23, 19:20 - Langar Me Khane Wala EP (IITD mate): Great stuff Vishal! Recently, we have been having quite a revolution with improved photogrammetry methods and Gaussian Splatting. But this is, in true essence, a generative image -> 3D mesh!
Can't imagine what people around the world will be building on top of this! 
Does anyone here have any ideas?

10/30/23, 14:50 - +91 90031 35354: Slightly different question, let me answer this too
10/30/23, 14:59 - +91 90031 35354: When u compare these 4 Packages, 

1. Textract (internally uses many other tools and packages including pdfminer for Text based pdf and Python-Docx for docx, Tesseract for Image based/Scanned PDFs, etc) but doesn't seem to work well now a days. I've developed and deployed 2 applications in prod in 2020 using this but now I'm not sure if it'll work.

2. PyPDF2 and PyPDF4, in some cases both give decent results along with Metadata that few other packages miss out. On paper this is a good package. This never went to prod.

3. Pdfminer - please skip this package as there are many dependency packages related to this package and the versions mostly conflict. Better to avoid this tension. This was rejected at POC level itself.

4. PyMuPDF (imported as fitz) is among the BEST package works very well on Text based PDFs. Have deployed multiple projects in prod. Also check out Pdfminer many say it's doing a good job. 

5. Python-Docx works really well on Docx documents. Works well in prod.

6. Windows based package I think win32 can convert doc to docx/pdf if Microsoft office is installed in the windows system running the application. Use only if no other choice.

Better to inform that support is only for PDF, Excel and DOCX formats.

7. For Excel docs - Pandas package manipulations are more than enough. Works well in prod.

11/1/23, 20:36 - +91 84387 68286: PyTorch or TensorFlow?

You talk to people online, and everyone is a die-hard PyTorch fan. You talk to people offline, and everyone is a die-hard TensorFlow fan.

Many people ask me the same question: which of these frameworks should you learn?

The research community rallied around PyTorch for a good reason: it's much easier to understand than TensorFlow. PyTorch code feels and looks like Python code. TensorFlow 2 is much better, but the first version left a bad aftertaste.

TensorFlow, however, built a more extensive ecosystem for productizing Machine Learning systems. What they lacked in clarity, they made up with tooling. They also added Keras, which improved the developer experience by 100x.

If you are starting today, which one should you learn?

I usually recommend that people pick the one everyone else around them uses. If you start working for a company that uses TensorFlow, learn TensorFlow. If you join a research lab that uses PyTorch, learn PyTorch.

You can also decide based on the material you are using. For example, these are my three favorite technical books (in no particular order):

1. Deep Learning with Python by Fran√ßois Chollet

2. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow by Aur√©lien G√©ron

3. Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn by Sebastian Raschka, PhD

The first two use TensorFlow and Keras. The last one uses PyTorch. If you have any of these books, learn the framework they use.

Ultimately, you may need both, and switching is easier than you think. The fundamental principles of building machine learning don't change. Everything else is a stylistic choice.

By the way, Keras 3.0 is coming out soon in the November, and it's a big deal. You can write your code in Keras and swap the backend to TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX without any changes. You can also combine different frameworks in the same codebase.

Keras 3.0 will be a standalone library, and you won't need TensorFlow anymore. I'm a huge fan, and I can't wait for everyone to try it.

11/6/23, 23:44 - +91 84387 68286: My idea is like, someone here already seen that there is navalgpt which is trained with Naval's quotes. It's a chatbot. It gives experience like we are talking to naval. 

My idea is, We can take a person, and collect his data like tweets and podcasts and train the model and make the model to write a book like Eric made. How's the idea. Any suggestions?
11/6/23, 23:47 - +91 92058 51034: Would be great if the tweets or podcasts are centric to a single topic. If they are varied alot then it won't be as much gripping, won't provide you the connecting dots in between. <This message was edited>

We are building open-source AI applications for financial data. First of these apps is MD&A (Management Discussion and Analysis) summarisation feature. It is just like any summarisation feature ‚Äî input is text + tables and output is summarised text. 

If you want to contribute to this project, more info can be found here: https://github.com/alphanome-ai/sec-ai/issues/39

If you need any help understanding it feel free to DM.

Let's say i have a usecase where user's want extended memory windows with each GPT chat. So i develop a platform offering autogen agents combined with memGPT to my end users.

Would love your support and feedback on the launch post

https://x.com/indievish/status/1722758580443697441?s=46&t=QQOykV6j0j4mrbVgjDdINQ
11/10/23, 16:18 - +91 98104 85533: this is very cool! could u give some hints on how to create something like this. not looking to build something commercial, just as a personal thing for my kids
11/10/23, 16:27 - +44 7404 656243: Yes it's very simple now with the recent gpts update. It's a no code way of creating a wrapper around gpt. 

So above toon gpt is nothing but a prompt wrapped around gpt4 and dalle. Watch the recent openai dev day video on yt.
11/10/23, 16:28 - +91 98919 01981: yeah on top of it, you can add a pdf or any doc's content to provide as knowledge to the bot
11/10/23, 16:29 - +91 98919 01981: and if you want to make the content dynamic you can even supply an openapi yaml file and let the bot fetch content dynamically with function calling
11/10/23, 16:29 - +91 98919 01981: only major issue I found is, it is quite slow
11/10/23, 16:30 - +91 98919 01981: and gets stuck a lot probably due to heavy traffic right now
11/10/23, 16:32 - +44 7404 656243: you could also do the same with assistants api - I hope that would be a little more stable
11/10/23, 16:33 - +91 98919 01981: Found the same issue with assistants api too, it errors a lot

11/11/23, 18:34 - +91 97246 54616: Need to think from fundamentals.

*Why we require Doctors for consultation at all ?* Specially for non-surgical & non-serous cases we need to eliminate them, bringing affordable health care to everyone.
11/11/23, 18:35 - +91 97246 54616: In last 6 months, I myself discussed 3 MRIs & other reports with AI models and their suggestions & remarks were way more accurate & useful then what doctors told later.
11/11/23, 18:37 - +91 92058 51034: In a third world country people won't appreciate even a single false positive or false negative. <This message was edited>
11/11/23, 18:38 - +91 92058 51034: I mean it's good to work on these things, expanding your horizons around these but not logically possible and convincing enough for people to adapt around this.
11/11/23, 18:46 - +91 97246 54616: This should not be the reason to hold back. 

We're not going to give affordable care to everyone by just increasing the volume of human doctors/thousands. It's even bullshit to approach that way. 

Need disruptive things at massive speed & scale.
11/11/23, 18:47 - +91 97246 54616: For UPI, the similar arguments were thrown. 

If you can show maximum good at cost of little side effects, people will trust & adopt
11/11/23, 18:47 - +91 92058 51034: I understand that, and improving healthcare using ML has been my primary goal as well in any project that I have done but we should think of solutions that bring changes that will be accepted as well, like small steps that makes a big impact rather than jumping up to a level we are not accomodated for.
11/11/23, 19:06 - +91 94825 40097: or let the doctors *type* the prescriptions instead.
11/11/23, 19:25 - +91 79950 39381: Hello folks ,
11/11/23, 19:28 - +91 79950 39381: Hello!! I need someone who can help me with feature extraction from a audio signal. If someone is in touch with MFCC, DWT or Fourier Transform and applied these on a audio data do DM me as I have some doubts regarding this process.
11/11/23, 19:34 - +91 97246 54616: It's marginal improvement, we're not going anywhere by such. 

For last 10 years, we haven't seen any significant changes in health care if we exclude Gov's push through Ayushyman Bharat. 

Now, we have far powerful technology that can help us to realise such vision.

Lot of founders are currently working on breakthrough aspects specially personal AI doctor for everyone is great game. üòä

So if you have built stuff before yes it‚Äôs already possible. My project bealloy is 80% built by ai.
11/18/23, 21:59 - +91 88585 06876: Thank you guys, yes i am realising that AI tools are great but they require a steep learning curve. So if all the components can be at one place it will be really great. I agree development knowldege is needed for sure, I am from a development background, have built 2 SAAS companies from scratch but I did with a team with their own expertise. This will be a nice experience to be able to do something using the power of AI. Whether am successful or not, I am pretty sure there will be a lot to learn and perhaps create a process in the whole journey which also a product at the end of the day.

11/23/23, 14:06 - +91 84148 94286: People who have used OpenAI tts after generating text. Do you start streaming right sequential to the streaming text generation or wait for text generation to complete?
11/23/23, 14:07 - +91 84148 94286: My only concern is streaming text will provide fragmented sentences to the tts resulting in bad enunciation
11/23/23, 14:09 - +91 75238 17665: Yeah this will happen i have tried streaming text in tts and results are not good
11/23/23, 14:27 - +91 84148 94286: Right. I am trying some hacks to send only complete sentences. Let‚Äôs see how it goes. Otherwise, I will move towards creating a llama+bark pipeline prototype

I am working on fine-tuning Llama on corpus of text (10k Lines). To fine tune I was thinking of splitting  the corpus into sentences and prepare dataset for training.

How to achieve splitting  corpus into sentences based on context length ?

11/24/23, 22:44 - +91 76174 06350: don't split based on length, instead use NLP libraries to split sentences. One library is Natural language toolkit ( nltk) with punkt tokenizer. Also search and try other libraries and compare which works better for your data.
11/24/23, 22:46 - +91 76174 06350: or use chatgpt/gpt-3.5-turbo to coherently split data.
11/24/23, 22:49 - +91 74116 35116: Thanks @917617406350 , I will try the first approach but not sure if I'm allowed to try second one because of privacy issues.

As of now I had used similar to SFT Trainer method for splitting based on tokens length and results are sub optimal.
11/24/23, 22:50 - +91 76174 06350: spliting based on length will never work
11/24/23, 22:53 - +91 76174 06350: if chatGPT isn't allowed then run llama-2-70b-chat on your own server, it'll take just few minutes to split data.
11/24/23, 22:54 - +91 76174 06350: can run llama privately on huggingface or replicate .com

11/24/23, 22:59 - +91 76174 06350: don't run llama-2 base model which is not useful without fine-tuning
11/24/23, 23:01 - +91 74116 35116: You mean Fine tuned for chat completion  ?
11/24/23, 23:02 - +91 74116 35116: As the above shared replicate one.
11/24/23, 23:02 - +91 76174 06350: base model can be fine-tuned for chat completion
11/24/23, 23:03 - +91 76174 06350: base model doesn't have chat completion functionality
11/24/23, 23:05 - +91 81044 28406: is there anyway to run openai gpr locally? I've seen other LLMs being run but was wondering if there is some method to achieve it

mainly from not letting sensitive data into openai servers
11/24/23, 23:06 - +91 74116 35116: Okay , Till now I was using base model. Now I will try out chat based llama models
11/24/23, 23:07 - +91 74116 35116: Thanks @917617406350 for all suggestions. Will update upon my experiments.
11/24/23, 23:08 - +91 76174 06350: share your learnings in fine-tuning llama-2 with the community here, will be helpful.
11/24/23, 23:11 - +91 74116 35116: Sure !!
11/24/23, 23:15 - +91 76174 06350: OpenAI GPT models can't be run locally like other open source models, but technically/legally data privacy can be maintained by running dedicated chatGPT server only for your company (Run by OpenAI for you) and it'll cost more than $200,000 per year

11/25/23, 10:49 - +91 81044 28406: won't there be privacy issues even w the private server? 

as they have the "your information might be used to train our model" 

so even on the private server all the account info / conversation history etc will be used

Unfortunately, this is not the first case of ideas from this group being used without credit. As open source principles encourage building on others' contributions, it is reasonable to expect members to acknowledge sources through citations. For example, the repository [https://github.com/linexjlin/GPTs] itself includes credits to the creators.  üôå

Second thing , He did not steal his idea . He found Nick‚Äôs prompt on a public domain , build his own idea and use that for a demo .

That‚Äôs why I found it overreacting.
Nick is promoting this GPT a lot now a days . He is just using Anil‚Äôs tweet to create hype in a provocative way which I don‚Äôt like.

12/6/23, 22:16 - +91 88103 86510: i would say that the data may be polluted also. gpt-4 data was scraped from internet as well as manual data.
12/6/23, 22:16 - +91 84387 68286: Bitter Truth
12/6/23, 22:17 - +91 88103 86510: google has really put lot of effort in gemini, because this will not be just for show. they will integrate it in their every service. so they will try their best to make sure the model is actually capable, and not good just on benchmarks
12/6/23, 22:17 - +91 88103 86510: similar to how meta uses its llama 2 model in its products
12/6/23, 22:19 - +91 84387 68286: Exactly
12/6/23, 22:21 - +91 88103 86510: honestly it was time for a change. openai really thought they have monopoly so they have been reducing capability of gpt-4 day by day.
12/6/23, 23:12 - +91 88585 06876: Thanks for sharing, I have started to use bard more than chatgpt because of performance issues.

12/7/23, 08:55 - +91 97246 54616: Sergey Brin was very much involved in Gemini. He's the core contributor to Gemini paper

He was coding everyday.


*This is founder Magic !!*
12/7/23, 08:56 - +91 88103 86510: Either the Gemini isn't any good, or bard is not running on gemini as they announced. let's see till APIs arrive, that will show the truth
12/7/23, 08:57 - +91 97246 54616: I think it's different case;

They made Google to chase GPT4 (released more than year ago) & while they seems to pick different orbit of intelligence building altogether : Q*
12/7/23, 08:58 - +91 88103 86510: Yep, but "open"AI definitely isn't open, and must not be trusted for the "benefit of humanity"
12/7/23, 09:01 - +91 97246 54616: That's different point, but they are most suitable & capable amongst all the available entity to build AGI. (Yes, Microsoft's control is pretty concerning)
12/7/23, 09:02 - +91 88103 86510: It's not concerning anymore, it's fully clear that openAI is a puppet of Microsoft and will be dissolved in Microsoft soon.
12/7/23, 09:02 - +91 88103 86510: Also the innovations don't follow the linear curve and come from unexpected places. Maybe we will see an open source model reach AGI, who knows
12/7/23, 09:13 - +91 97246 54616: This much harsh take. 

After this episode they was high chances Microsoft would have taken controlling board seat or demanded dismantling of Non profit structure. 


But as I've followed Sam for quite long time, he's hell ambitious entrepreneur (very few can match Elon's stature, he's one of them) with extreme Drive, Determination & Sanity to pull things off.

So he can't give Microsoft all this stuff. Hence, arrangement he negotiated is fulfilling he's vision. 

(Sam understood this much earlier that Microsoft will be necessary evil here as building AGI will require insane amount of capital & compute, he's targeting for raising $100Bn.)
12/7/23, 09:13 - +91 97246 54616: I'm not saying he or OpenAI is immune from criticism but they certainly are much better positioned & credible.
12/7/23, 09:17 - +91 97246 54616: That's much desired. Let's hope & do it. üôåüî•
12/7/23, 10:27 - +91 88103 86510: Here's how I see it:

Board tries to fire CEO who was pushing monetization too much and *may have ignored safety risk*. Board gets fired instead.

Sam claims open has no personal stake, but uses popularity gained from OpenAI to make RainAI and makes OpenAI buy from it.

Sam was fully ready to destroy OpenAI when they tried to fire him.

OpenAI despite claiming to be so "open", refused to say anything about the reasons of such serious matter.

OpenAI raised funding as non-profit, then as soon as they made something good, became for-profit in the name of "safety", while themselves ignoring all safety warnings.

Sam actively spread fake fears of AI killing everyone to get regulations in his favour to maintain monopoly.

Sam harvested biometrics data from third-world countries in the name of digital identity, from the people who have no idea of the dangers of that data.

Microsoft immediately agreed to make separate department with all employees of openAI (not much against Microsoft, they are for-profit and they don't lie about it).

Sam claiming that it's "illogical" for people to expect reason of recent events from "Open"AI which is supposedly non-profit and supposedly works for humanity.

Also what's the point of making AGI if that AGI is going to be in control of that "necessary evil", wouldn't that make AGI also somewhat evil? How will that fulfil the charter of "Open"AI which is supposedly "benefit all humanity"?

They are just taking advantage of lack of knowledge of people to spread fear. They didn't open-source new gpt models claiming it was "dangerous", people will make bio-weapons with it. LLaMa 2, Mistral, and many other open-source models come pretty-close to GPT-3.5 and I don't see anyone making bio-weapons with them.

They used copyrighted material without consent and declined to disclose dataset details despite being "Open"AI.

They tried to trademark "GPT" word. How will that help in developing AGI?

All that "necessary evil" and all the fluffy big talk is to distract people from the truth. I am not saying what is right or wrong, I am simply saying these are the facts and this is how "Open"AI and Sam work, so it's how the response should be.

We don't live in a fairy tale, everyone wants money and power, including Sam and "Open"AI. And gaining monopoly on AI is a quick way to get that, so they are conspiring to spread false fear to world leaders who have no idea how technology works.

12/7/23, 12:23 - +91 76174 06350: benchmarks are a bit higher than GPT-4 but GPT-4 was released 18 months back, so Google isn't ahead of OpenAI. OpenAI's model with A* would be coming soon that'll widen the gap a lot.
12/7/23, 12:37 - +91 88103 86510: Q*
12/7/23, 12:37 - +91 88103 86510: Honestly open-source LLMs are doing 100x better than Google
12/7/23, 15:03 - +91 96647 15556: *Summary of Gemini's 60-page technical report.*

1. Written in Jax and trained using TPUs. The architecture, while not explained in details, seems similar to Flamigo's.

2. Gemini Pro's performance is similar to GPT-3.5 and Gemini Ultra is reported to be better than GPT-4. Nano-1 (1.8B params) and Nano-2 (3.25B params) are designed to run on-device.

3. 32K context length.

4. Very good at understanding vision and speech.

5. Coding ability: the big jump in HumanEval compared to GPT-4 (74.4% vs. 67%), if true, is awesome. However, the Natural2Code benchmark (no leakage on the Internet) shows a much smaller gap (74.9% vs. 73.9%).

6. On MMLU: using COT@32 (32 samples) to show that Gemini is better than GPT-4 seems forced. In 5-shot setting, GPT-4 is better (86.4% vs. 83.7%).

7. No information at all on the training data, other than they ensured "all data enrichment workers are paid at least a local living wage."

Will take a break for the end of the year and start working from the beginning of the year. 

Have a nice weekend

I have been using this Startegy framework called Wardley Mapping invented by Simon Wardley, since 6 years. Over a due course of time, I applied it to Technology and Business, that helped me put my experiences in the form of case studies in this book.

I stay in Bangalore, and I saw some of you wanting to connect. I am open to  meet people in Bangalore or have virtual connect if you stay in other places in India.

There is a whole community of Practitioners of Wardley Mapping who are involved in research on topics such as AI, Cybersecurity, Business, Education, Manufacturing etc. 

Happy to connect with you to share more. 

Have a good time.

1/19/24, 23:18 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: I haven‚Äôt read the article but what metric have they used to evaluate ? And also if I understand it right if we want to  train new language the data has to be a bit of English in kus new language as fine tuning ? Thanks for the summary
1/19/24, 23:20 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: We have same issue with audio training .. the tokenizer training is the hardest part .. if a new language has new phonemes it‚Äôs a dead end ..
1/19/24, 23:42 - +91 90746 83618: Are you finetuning whisper? I am also heavily working on finetuning the whisper and deployment part and faced the same issue, I am trying some new techniques from recent papers.

1/20/24, 00:48 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Nop not whisper we have other custom model .. but it was trained with English , fine tuning with other languages specially non Latin ones is not satisfactory

1/20/24, 00:57 - +91 90746 83618: That's decent amount of data, you should try whisper on that, it's good to adapt new languages

1/20/24, 02:39 - +91 90746 83618: Yes, Checked long back, But in my case, whisper yields better results.
1/20/24, 02:40 - +91 96001 46419: Interesting. You mean on multilingual usecase?
1/20/24, 02:40 - +91 96001 46419: Or just English

1/25/24, 10:05 - +91 72474 89270: As @919891901981 mentioned caching can be used, but if you use it a couple of times you'll understand, there is a lot going on behind the scene
1/25/24, 11:10 - +91 98104 85533: Well I'm not able to understand what is it specifically that they are doing.
Are they leveraging other search engines and created a RAG on top of it ? Or are they fundamentally indexing.

Both have different approaches
1/25/24, 11:11 - +91 72474 89270: We can just guess
1/25/24, 11:13 - +91 72474 89270: I feel that indexing the whole internet is quite a costly task, so better use other search engines and just go to results of top 2-3 pages
1/25/24, 20:28 - +91 99712 24643: Nice work Aditya, and thanks for releasing it. Followed you on X. <This message was edited>

1/27/24, 11:55 - +91 82090 10128: We recorded this 4 months back, made a few mistakes during recording and improvised in the recent podcasts.

This was a very candid conversation where Ashish shared insights from his 12,000+ crore merger with MakeMyTrip and acquisition of RedBus.

1/31/24, 19:00 - +91 76174 06350: it's only for a niche area of mathematics not general mathematics like this same deepmind model would be stupid in solving differential equations specially third & higher degree equations
1/31/24, 19:10 - +91 90746 83618: It was fascinating, Google Deepmind paper : https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6
1/31/24, 20:59 - +91 88678 52683: I think there is still a fundamental question of weather LLM is the right framework for AGI
1/31/24, 21:01 - +91 72474 89270: It will be a critical component
1/31/24, 21:02 - +91 88678 52683: I think it'll require another breakthrough system which can do planning and abstraction, which along with LLM can achieve it
1/31/24, 21:02 - +91 88678 52683: yes agreed
1/31/24, 21:03 - +91 72474 89270: LLMs already do that see chain of thoughts
1/31/24, 21:06 - +91 88678 52683: Aware of that. its still hardcoded in input. Goal based panning systems and agents are pretty limited still for generic cases
1/31/24, 21:20 - +91 97246 54616: Ability to Reason on itself will unlock lots of powerful aspects. There's still we've limitations.
1/31/24, 21:35 - +91 99712 24643: I think LLM's will be the primary interfaces for AGI.
1/31/24, 21:37 - +91 99712 24643: Present day LLM's might lack on intelligence but they're good with Communication.
1/31/24, 21:39 - +91 72474 89270: I feel they are quite intelligent to attack a lot of jobs by humans right now
1/31/24, 21:39 - +91 97246 54616: Large Action Models sounds much near to AGI than standalone language understanding & generating machine.

2/6/24, 20:06 - +91 90746 83618: I guide a group of students from Lucknow called the Lucknow AI Labs. I am trying to mentor them in AI research by sharing the latest research papers, helping them implement papers, and clearing their doubts. The students come from different parts of Uttar Pradesh where quality guidance and resources for AI are lacking. The aim is to produce some high-quality papers from the college itself, guide these students, and train them for the upcoming future.

The project is going well so far. I would welcome anyone interested in helping to guide these students and sharing their AI research knowledge and expertise.

2/16/24, 00:19 - +91 90285 66587: Your message is not only  disrespectful towards another fellow entrepreneur but at the same time contradicts the statement by giving halfass information about whatever you are doing. I think a business owner thinking that self-promotion is shaming is living in a dreamland and doesn't understand the start-up eco-system. If you actually do manage to scale your start-up, you'll understand that successful businesses thrive on collaboration, mutual trust within the industry and with overlapping industries.
Moreover, tbh I was told by one of the members of this group( who btw has 2 successful start-ups of his own) to join and post about the services CDK provides as he thought that many entrepreneurs and others might find it extremely helpful. 
We have tie-ups  directly with National distributors of Asus,msi, Nvidia etc. CDK already is working with some of the top architectural firms, 3d rendering firms, animation studios across western-MH. 
My motivation behind posting about my start-up was beyond self-promotion; rather it was driven by genuine desire to contribute to the community and foster meaningful connections. I urge all fellow entrepreneurs to not act like crabs and pull eachother down, but rather support one another. A business owner who lacks ethical values and principles cannot build a business consisting these fundamental values.
2/16/24, 00:30 - +91 99712 24643: Hey Tanuj, I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings nor do I have an issue with self promotions or the people who do.

A major part of the groups I am in strictly prohibit adding any links or being spammy in any kind so I just try adhere by the rules in general.

I designed my message to not fell intrusive or spammy and reach my intended audience at the same time. 

Which it did and I'm thankful to everyone who contacted me and I'm sincerely enjoying the new collaborations.

I'm sorry if you didn't find it apt, it was all in good faith. üôè

2/20/24, 19:59 - +91 86191 15677: Hey good folks,
I have a question.

Let's say I have a 1000 word article. And I want to perform a semantic question and answer on top of it. What should I do?
1. Store the embeddings of this article in a vector store and use langchain retrieval to get the answers?
2. Stuff this article with the question prompt itself?
3. Perform RAG (Isn't RAG similar to 1?)
2/20/24, 20:13 - +91 90290 81083: 1000 words is not much... Just paste it into the prompt as context
2/20/24, 20:16 - +91 86191 15677: Have you observed any issues with accuracy in retrieval steps with prompt stuffing?
PS: I'm intentionally not telling you my results up front so that I don't bias you. (Happy to share if you want me to)
2/20/24, 20:33 - +91 63622 60992 joined using this group's invite link
2/20/24, 20:39 - +91 90290 81083: Not with openAI
2/20/24, 20:39 - +91 90290 81083: Dunno with other open source LLMs ... I would suspect this may be the case with some of them
2/20/24, 20:39 - +91 99712 24643: 1. Yes, your #1 and #3 are exactly same
2. You should go for #2 as most of LLM's have at least 2k context window
2/20/24, 20:42 - +91 86191 15677: Thanks Gurdeep and Harsh.
Btw,
What's the decision making process like in order to pick among "Prompt vs embedding search vs rag".
Does it come down only to the size of documents wrt to the context length of the llm? <This message was edited>
2/20/24, 20:43 - +91 86191 15677: Also, I was reading about "loss in the middle" argument for the attached context document. 
Does it occur only in the cases where the document is _larger_ or does it occur for a 1000 word document too?
2/20/24, 21:05 - +91 99712 24643: Yes
2/20/24, 21:05 - +91 99712 24643: Yes
2/20/24, 21:06 - +91 99712 24643: 1000 works is approximately 900 tokens, if that's your max length you're good to go with prompts
2/20/24, 21:06 - +91 99712 24643: But if it will be unpredictable in the future, go for RAG
2/20/24, 21:11 - +91 90052 36891: You can use BERT/T5 or GPT2 Models too to do question answer. It might be require fine tuning of models, but will work well too
2/20/24, 21:11 - +91 90052 36891: Basically, Provide context, and question, the model will return answer
2/20/24, 21:22 - +91 88103 86510: anyone here has access to gemini 1.5? what is your experience?
2/20/24, 21:27 - +91 99984 30495: shouldn't the #of tokens be more than the #of words? As the tokens are subword units <This message was edited>
2/20/24, 21:29 - +91 99712 24643: It depends, use a calculator
2/20/24, 21:34 - +91 99984 30495: Exactly, there are models that are trained specifically on the QA datasets like SQUADv2 which not only answers (verbatim) from the article if answer exists, but also return if answers do not. So if your application is to extract answers verbatim from this article, then models like https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2 would suffice. If you are looking for generative answers, then go the LLM way
2/20/24, 21:40 - +91 75300 04661: <Media omitted>
2/20/24, 21:40 - +91 86191 15677: What do you mean exactly when you say _generative_ way?
Does it mean when the expected output isn't just retrieval, but some enhancements on top of it?
2/20/24, 21:41 - +91 86191 15677: Yes as in - it occurs for 1000 words documents too?
2/20/24, 21:43 - +91 86191 15677: I understand one of the reason to use BERT/T5 or GPT2 Models for QA would be cheaper cost as compared to relatively expensive model like GPT-4. 
Any other reasons? Perhaps low latency, Or they have higher accuracy as compared to gpt-4?

Eager to know your thoughts.
2/20/24, 21:47 - +91 86191 15677: Arvind, I just tried this for my use-case, it failed. It gave entirely wrong answer.
By wrong answer I mean, it did not perform the retrival correctly at all.
2/20/24, 21:48 - +91 99984 30495: basically outputs of ChatGPT like models, whose outputs are generated one token at a time. To the latter question, since your article size fits within context, forget the term retrieval (as it a method used when you have to find for context to answer your question from say 1000 pages instead of 1000 words)
2/20/24, 21:51 - +91 86191 15677: Got the meaning of generative. Thanks.

As for the second part of your response - do you mean that "retrieval" is a method used whenever we are finding relevant information (say top k matches) from a data set whose size is greater than the context length of the model? (And perhaps we are using something like map reduce to help us do that?) <This message was edited>
2/20/24, 21:56 - +91 99984 30495: yes. "retrieval" in its literal sense. It is to first find the relevant portion of your large doc and provide it along with the prompt, to help llm with the context of your question
2/20/24, 21:57 - +91 99984 30495: This is RAG. In your case there is no retrieval as the entire "doc" fits the context length of most llms <This message was edited>
2/20/24, 21:58 - +91 86191 15677: Gotcha, thanks for explaining the "retrieval" meaning.
2/20/24, 21:59 - +91 99984 30495: DM me, so I can understand your use case
2/20/24, 22:01 - +91 86191 15677: sure

2/20/24, 22:09 - +91 86191 15677: In my experience too I have usually seen the token count >= word count. 

Although I can steel man the argument for the case that it possible for token count < word count. But unable to think of encodings which are clubbing words in terms of tokens.

2/21/24, 21:30 - +91 79950 39381: Hello folks. Can someone suggest any opensource best image classification models which can classify graphs which are very similar to each other?  Fine tuned and used CLIP but accuracy is low and its mostly over fitting
2/21/24, 21:42 - +91 99712 24643: Which models have you tried so far?
2/21/24, 21:43 - +91 79950 39381: Swin transformers , resnet 50 , CLIP
2/21/24, 21:45 - +91 99984 30495: Typical advantages are to reduce vocabulary size and handle unseen words during inference
2/21/24, 21:47 - +91 99984 30495: Ig as said in the GPT4, if the phrases are too frequent then it makes sense to learn them as one token thereby reducing the effective no of tokens to predict (this is important, as over longer sequences the performance usually takes a hit)
2/21/24, 21:55 - +91 99712 24643: Try a yolo based model? I've had the best accuracy in those
2/21/24, 21:55 - +91 79950 39381: Sure will give it a try. Any other suggestions?
2/21/24, 21:56 - +91 99712 24643: The models in detectron library are worth exploring

3/7/24, 01:39 - +91 84148 94286: Has anyone worked on an AI app where the LLM uses RAG on user-encrypted data? It‚Äôs an E2E encrypted app with the user given a randomly generated seed at the time of sign up for encrypting their data. 

Now we wish to integrate basic AI features such as summarisation, tagging, entity identification to this. 

Problem is we don‚Äôt have access to user data as it can only be unlocked client side. 

Any ideas?!
3/7/24, 02:13 - +91 99712 24643: RAG on client must be quite possible, what issues are you facing?
3/7/24, 02:37 - +91 84148 94286: 1. The size of user data is quite large as it contains pdfs, images as well.
2. ‚Å†the AI operation is to happen in a fixed interval as a cron job not realtime. 
3. ‚Å†it‚Äôs a legacy app so the new trendy AI architecture feels quite unfit and also the word ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù is taboo.

So far my best idea is to create a shadow table using a temp time based key containing vector embeddings that syncs up with the main one.
3/7/24, 02:39 - +91 99712 24643: Might defeat the idea of E2E if the shadow table doesn't use the same encryption
3/7/24, 02:40 - +91 84148 94286: Yeah. But vector embeddings are one way encrypted right?!
3/7/24, 02:40 - +91 99712 24643: For a true E2E setup even the LLM should be client side. That's what apple is planning.
3/7/24, 02:41 - +91 99712 24643: Depends
3/7/24, 02:41 - +91 99712 24643: Embeddings can be as simple as a numpy array

3/8/24, 11:41 - +44 7404 656243: simplest way is to split the transcript into multiple rows based on your speaker delimiter and attach the speaker name as metadata -> then embed each row -> save it in db -> run your rag against it
3/8/24, 11:42 - +44 7404 656243: ps: also attach the timestamps and any other data that might be relevant as metadata
3/8/24, 12:04 - +91 90290 81083: Interesting... Any suggestions on how to split the doc based on speaker delimitation... assuming I am able to extract speakers as entities from the document?
3/8/24, 12:06 - +44 7404 656243: It could be a simple regex.
But depends on your transcript format. For example assembly ai already gives you utterances array
3/8/24, 12:06 - +91 63794 73054: Anybody here in IIT-M?

3/12/24, 20:41 - +91 89087 56505: overall ui looks good and good use of glassmorphism

3/12/24, 22:29 - +91 89290 90206: Yes, it is horrible
3/12/24, 22:30 - +91 89290 90206: Boot times are many a times upto 7-8 minutes
3/12/24, 22:30 - +91 89290 90206: If we are taking api from replicate, we always prefer downloading their docker image. And deploying it on runpod
3/12/24, 22:30 - +91 89290 90206: Which has 2-3 sec boot times
3/12/24, 22:32 - +91 98104 85533: do you see value in their docker image ? versus building your own ?
3/12/24, 22:33 - +91 89290 90206: Replicate's api are quick workarounds. It's always better to make ur own api
3/12/24, 22:34 - +91 89290 90206: Most of the times, they download stuff from hugging face (models, tokenizers, etc)
3/12/24, 22:34 - +91 89290 90206: Which slows down things a lot.
3/12/24, 22:34 - +91 89290 90206: And can be avoided by using a cache directory in local
3/12/24, 22:35 - +91 89290 90206: But yes, their api can be used as a starting point to make your own api
3/12/24, 22:35 - +91 89290 90206: As they have most of the dependencies resolved and saves a lot of development time

‚Ä¢ Invest heavily in digital businesses and enterprise transformation to support the French AI ecosystem and make it one of the world's leaders.
‚Ä¢ Make France and Europe a major hub for computing power in the short and medium term.
‚Ä¢ Transform our approach to personal data to continue protecting while facilitating innovation to meet our needs.
‚Ä¢ Ensure the influence of French culture by providing access to cultural content while respecting intellectual property rights.
‚Ä¢ Embrace the principle of experimentation in public AI research to enhance its attractiveness.
‚Ä¢ Structure a coherent and concrete diplomatic initiative aimed at establishing a global governance of AI.

x.ai Open sources Grok-1 <This message was edited>
3/18/24, 08:25 - +91 99712 24643: 300+ GB and not fine-tuned on any tasks
3/18/24, 08:26 - +91 99712 24643: They just released for the sake of it
3/18/24, 08:31 - +91 88103 86510: It's a base model
3/18/24, 08:33 - +91 88103 86510: I think you don't understand it's use case. Base model can be fine-tuned by community easily. Instruct models are not a requirement for open-source.
3/18/24, 08:34 - +91 88103 86510: It's Apache 2 license. That's not "just for the sake". It's more open than a lot of open-source models today.
3/18/24, 08:39 - +91 99712 24643: It was a matter of proving transparency when Elon announced it in the xAI vs oAI case. Guess they weren't ready to go the full way.

There are several other open source models using a similar architecture (MoE and RoPE) that are smaller, finetuned and will perform certainly better than than "this" release of grok.
3/18/24, 08:56 - +91 88103 86510: I would wait for "Open"AI to do even 50% transparent release of this lol
3/18/24, 08:56 - +91 99712 24643: Yeah that has zero chances to happen
3/18/24, 08:56 - +91 88103 86510: But only on some specific tasks. Ofcourse because they are fine tuned. You can fine-tune a 7B model to get 99% on benchmarks. Doesn't mean that's useful.
3/18/24, 08:57 - +91 88103 86510: From your logic even LLaMa-2 base model is useless. But in reality it has much more value than the chat tuned version. Because Chat is just one use-case. There are so many other use-cases which can be satisfied by fine-tuned models of base model
3/18/24, 08:58 - +91 88103 86510: I think most of today's open-source models aren't ready to go full way. Most of them can't reveal exact data else they will get bombarded with copyright with proofs.
3/18/24, 09:05 - +91 88103 86510: Also since it's not tuned for anything, there is pretty high chance that's it's raw uncensored model

3/19/24, 21:50 - +91 99712 24643: Checking colours might be possible
3/19/24, 21:52 - +91 99712 24643: you can extract sections you want to check using object detection
3/19/24, 21:52 - +91 99712 24643: then use some basic (non AI) algorithms to check colours
3/19/24, 21:52 - +91 99712 24643: then use a model like https://huggingface.co/gaborcselle/font-identifier to identify fonts <This message was edited>

3/20/24, 09:51 - +91 84602 38402: 1. Circle fitting algorithms: These algorithms work by finding the circle that best fits the edge of the pupil in the image. The diameter of the pupil can then be calculated from the radius of the fitted circle.

2. Hough transform: The Hough transform is a technique that can be used to identify circles in images. It can be used to find the center and radius of the pupil, from which the diameter can be calculated.

These methods are typically used in conjunction with other image processing techniques, such asgrayscale conversion, thresholding, and edge detection. These preprocessing steps can help to improve the accuracy of the pupil diameter measurement.

Measuring the diameter precisely is a challenge as you don‚Äôt have a scale r√©f√©rence. You need to have something on the photo with a known length which you use to calibrate the scale. We usually used standard metric metrology gages for high precision and the gage has to be at the same level as the pupil <This message was edited>

3/22/24, 16:03 - +91 95557 40636: Hello everyone. 
I need some guidance. I‚Äôm making a AI model that would  cluster images from bunch of images uploaded on a database ex(MongoDB) it should give all images to that person just by uploading a selfie. I need to maintain minimal server cost so the model should be efficient. Can anyone here guide me regarding approach to this problem.
3/22/24, 18:41 - +91 88662 83896: i think you need to use https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition library to create embeddings of every image and then compare embedding to find closest match for embedding of selfie image.
3/22/24, 18:54 - +44 7404 656243: Yes you can fetch knn using a vector db. So create embedding of each extracted face along with the info of the full pic in the vector db as payload. Then when the selfie comes in just create embedding for it and run a similarity search which vector db gives you out of the box. 

Don‚Äôt think you need a model for it apart from an embedding model.
Keep it simple
3/22/24, 19:01 - +44 7404 656243: I believe you can also use mongo as your vector db
3/22/24, 19:01 - +91 95557 40636: yes
3/22/24, 19:02 - +91 95557 40636: also  I want to ask if it would be enough for large scale
3/22/24, 19:05 - +44 7404 656243: I think so.
Also if it‚Äôs poc stage don‚Äôt worry  too much about scaling right now. Do things in a non scalable way if required to keep moving forward.
3/22/24, 19:07 - +91 95557 40636: okay

- Kinetic Typography: A style where the text is used as the primary visual element, with the words and letters moving, transforming, and interacting in creative ways to convey the message.
- Minimalist/Typographic: A clean, minimalist approach where the focus is on the text itself, without excessive visual elements. The text may be presented in a stylized manner, with attention to typography, layout, and subtle animations.
- Illustrated/Graphic: Combining the generated text with illustrations, icons, or other graphic elements to create a more visually rich and expressive video.
- Live-Action with Text Overlay: Incorporating the generated text as overlays or captions on top of live-action footage, creating a mixed media effect.
- Text-to-Speech Animation: Generating a video where the text is converted to a voice-over, and the words are animated to sync with the narration.
- Interactive/Scrolling Text: Creating a video where the text scrolls, pans, or interacts with the viewer, encouraging active engagement with the content.

It might be some work but will be very low latency and cost effective
4/18/24, 12:02 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Thanks @919005236891 will try this as well. 
How is mmocr compared to other ocr extraction tools available online like Azure AI vision and AWS textract?
4/18/24, 12:04 - +91 90052 36891: Ohh it works quite well. 
We use it. It is open source.
And it's performance after fine tuning > Azure or Google apis for English and or other languages

5/3/24, 20:47 - +91 90746 83618: We need to bring more Good quality models from India.

5/4/24, 06:49 - +91 63695 89236: Loving it
5/4/24, 12:50 - +91 63622 60992: AGREED!!! however, we should also focus on developing top-tier expert agents in leading fields. India is recognized globally for its vast human resources, and similarly, we need to build extensive AI infrastructure. By fostering expert AI agents, we can offer their services worldwide, enabling the development of innovative solutions. This strategy will help maintain India's position as a leader in the AI community.

Top LLM might be owned by OAI, Meta or Anthropic. But we should own the top healthcare agent, engineering agent, research agent, Coding Agent.
5/4/24, 12:58 - +91 90746 83618: Yes but agents are mostly Apis calling, we need to build the base, need some home LLMs first, relying on them is not a good idea.
5/4/24, 13:01 - +91 90746 83618: I am somewhat puzzled by our current approach. We have a team of incredibly talented individuals and access to high-quality data, yet we seem to be focusing on short-term goals, such as quickly gaining acceptance into Y Combinator and implementing hasty solutions with apis. I fear that these actions, while potentially lucrative in the short term, may not lead to lasting success. The OpenAI assistant APIs serve as an example of this type of approach.

Instead, I believe we should adopt a more long-term perspective and concentrate our efforts on building a strong foundation for our work. This could involve curating top-notch datasets, releasing groundbreaking and fundamental models, and publishing innovative research papers. By doing so, we can establish ourselves as leaders in the field and provide others with the opportunity to build APIs and agents based on our robust models. <This message was edited>
5/4/24, 13:02 - +91 90746 83618: I acknowledge that my perspective is just one among many.
5/4/24, 15:08 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: My take on this : this is a long post. 
You are spot on concerning the long term and short term goals. But the field is such that it is quasi impossible to provide a long term solution with all the rapid advances unless you have an unfair advantage over others like proprietary legal data etc. This is how business that has existed more than 20 years have done it. 
When I look at all the hyped ai companies, their offer can be turned irrelevant in a few days. I put mistral , perplexity, scale in this case.
And the other aspect is are you building your solution to make quick evaluations and get investor money or go long term solving customer problems but will take long time and more robust business model.
We need a complete ecosystem if we want to even compete and use our force to compete rather than what others do.

India has always been frugal in its approaches. Look at space sector, agriculture, cricket and previously call centers. It‚Äôs all based on frugal successes. 
We can never compete with the likes of meta with 24000 gpu. We need private nuclear reactors for that to run. We don‚Äôt have that kind of infrastructure.
One way to overtake is to work on alternate transformer models which makes gpu irrelevant. I have met people working on this in Eastern Europe and it‚Äôs the only way to compete with richer organisations.
We need to think out of the box !
5/4/24, 15:29 - +91 90746 83618: I agree that building a complete ecosystem and leveraging our collective strengths is crucial for competing effectively.While it's true that we shouldn't solely rely on government support or wait for an extended period, I believe there might be a middle ground we could explore.

Perhaps we could consider leveraging our existing resources and collaborating with like-minded individuals or groups who share our vision. By pooling our efforts and funding, we may be able to make meaningful progress and establish valuable connections within the AI community. These connections could open up new avenues for exploration and innovation. By demonstrating our commitment and delivering tangible contributions to the field, we can capture the attention of key stakeholders and encourage their involvement in our initiatives such as nvidia , runpod support etc for better and large scale experiments.

It's my personal opinion, but I'm also eager to hear the thoughts and opinions of others.
5/4/24, 15:38 - +91 63622 60992: Exactly, my point as well. As Pavan says scraping such big data or to gain access to GPU makes it harder to create huge LLM models (also interested to know how aadi did it with llama). Atleast to exist in early AI space, the easiest approach would be to make Applied AI solutions(agents).

But Fund Pooling and sharing efforts could create valuable progress. We could do something even better than individuals falling into the trap of short term goals with AI.

Looking forward to this community of AI indian enthusiasts to build something big together. Will be happy to be part of it.
5/4/24, 15:43 - +91 97767 76943: Yes, we need an ecosystem from ground up that proves to cater creators across globe on an infrastructure that is resilient and growing. I‚Äôm working on this mission since 2020, hooking up with some professionals across practices, but I‚Äôll be honest the commitment to build on this is not for faint hearted as it will need tremendous amount of work. If we can pool resources to achieve this, we can achieve this. Sharing my document of the solution vision, if it aligns with you, we may colab. Thank you.

5/5/24, 11:16 - +91 90746 83618: No, This is just a draft idea, I know the direction and source to collect data etc but we need to work collectively to collect good data and some funds for model training
5/5/24, 11:20 - +91 91385 04897: ohh, I have similar idea but that doesn't need any tuning. LLMs has good enough reasomning which we can exploit ..
5/5/24, 11:21 - +91 90746 83618: For a specific usecase yes but I am talking about releasing the model for worldwide

5/5/24, 13:51 - +91 63622 60992: What is the approx fund that would come into picture , as you have already worked on bio you might foresee a figure
5/5/24, 14:09 - +91 90746 83618: If we have everything ready, know the exact good hyperparameters, the path won't take much time, but it's not straightforward; it requires multiple iterations, which can be little costly.
5/5/24, 14:23 - +91 90746 83618: Fine-tuning won't take much , but good quality data curation is more time taking.

5/6/24, 14:31 - +91 97246 54616: Monetizing intelligence directly will produce mediocre businesses (licensing).

Monetizing intelligence indirectly will produce spectacular businesses (centralized networks).

Monetizing the continuous production of intelligence will produce more value than we can imagine (decentralized networks).

5/11/24, 15:22 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): like entire stack transcription+LLM response + Synthesizer
5/11/24, 15:25 - +91 63622 60992: So custom memory might be a pre update to bring in stack transcription to capture long term memory but in a concise way! Woah!
5/11/24, 15:26 - +91 63622 60992: This would allow GPT to decide, what to store about us and what to ignore?!?!!
5/11/24, 15:29 - +44 7404 656243: Does anyone know when assistants v2 are coming to azure openai?
5/11/24, 15:31 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Or maybe they don't integrate transcription, only LLM + TTS. 
Transcription is tricky and vast to cover

5/18/24, 20:21 - +91 70773 54197: hi everyone, what's the most effective way to perform RAG on structured data( tabular data/ CSV files...) ?
5/18/24, 20:32 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Langchain sql agent
5/18/24, 20:36 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: We worked on industrial data streamed directly into a Rag solution with this ..
5/18/24, 20:37 - +91 70773 54197: did ur use case include real time data ingestion by any chance?
5/18/24, 20:39 - +91 98104 85533: Is anyone here using langchainjs or any other GenAI js framework?

What kind of applications are u building? 
Context is we are building a library for enterprise RPA kind of usecases...and wanted to get some feedback
5/18/24, 20:40 - +91 70773 54197: thank you for responding, I believe this agent performs Text-2-SQL under the hood ? Please correct me if I am wrong,  what about handling queries which wud require spatial reasoning or contextual awareness, like what if the text cannot be directly converted into a SQL Query to run on top of the given data ?
5/18/24, 20:41 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Yes
5/18/24, 20:43 - +91 70773 54197: wow okay niceee,  was the turnaround time or the latency wrt the real time data ingestion and indexing acceptable ?, although i believe this is subjective and wud depend on the type of features in the dataset and the number of features.....I might be wrong
5/18/24, 20:44 - +91 90290 81083: Check vanna.ai
5/18/24, 20:44 - +91 70773 54197: okay thank youuuu
5/18/24, 21:43 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Technically it‚Äôs not a RAG we did it‚Äôs more of function calling when required from SQL .. so data is quasi realtime called when required . So we don‚Äôt do any sort of embedding which in turn inmproves latency
5/19/24, 07:03 - +91 63695 89236: Yep used langchain js to build multiple prod apps.
5/19/24, 10:05 - +91 70773 54197: Understood.
5/19/24, 10:05 - +91 70773 54197: Thank you
5/19/24, 11:18 - +91 95974 43458: Will it work for domain based data? We tried the same. For general domain data, it worked. For medical domain based text to sql, it didn't answer a question
5/19/24, 11:23 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: The result actually depends on data in the sql and how to extract this data. You can contact me if you have issues. We have used it on pharmaceutical data and mechanical soldering engineering data.. also depends on which model you use .. a lot of trial and error for the moment
5/19/24, 11:23 - +91 95974 43458: Sure bro. Will DM you. Thanks

5/21/24, 07:30 - +91 99580 07011: Hey folks, at Chargespot (https://chargespot.app) we are building a new kind of OS for EVs, with a lot AI native functionality. 

We have two major AI pipelines we are working on. The first one is more about predictive range estimation where we are building a model for every EV vehicle in India, from 2W to 4W to buses. We plan on adding telemetry data which gives us real time data and insights into the vehicle which we use to improve. We use all of this to better predict the range and help them plan trips with over 30k charging stations in the country with real time data. 

The second one is building an LLM that helps troubleshoot and answer questions about their vehicle. Rag for now, but we want to make it better as we go forward.

If anyone here is interested in any of helping us with any of these things, I would love to hear your thoughts. Please drop a DM

As part of my academic curriculum, I am required to complete a 4 week internship after my third year, and I am reaching out to inquire if there might be an opportunity to intern with your esteemed organization.

I have a strong foundation in Python programming and a keen interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Last year, I completed a six-week internship at Lincode, a company specializing in AI-based solutions for quality assurance in industrial settings. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also sparked a deeper passion for applying AI in real-world scenarios.

I am enthusiastic and eager to learn more about the innovative work being done in your organization. I am particularly interested in projects involving AI, machine learning, and Python development.

There is actually a scarcity of AI engineers who can solve real world problems using AI.

If it‚Äôs a template it would be difficult to get it in lottie since everything is a vector, I would suggest looking into remotion.

If it‚Äôs the other case, envato elements should be good too

6/9/24, 14:18 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: Hey I am planning to do a community call on WhatsApp next week on the following subject : How to improve evaluation capabilities of LLM.

The idea is to give an introduction to the subject. See if anyone else has worked on it and brainstorm ideas. Problem : LLM are very bad at making judgements, if you ask : am I cute ? The answer is just encouraging. They are overly aligned which masks its judgement to make decisions and the judgement will depend on the training data used. 

If you are interested we can organise a call. If it works we can do it a weekly thing where we create a small group and make a 1 hour call to talk on a specific subject that can help you advance in your own projects ..

Who is in ? Message me

You could use whisper there.

6/12/24, 13:52 - +91 98119 67439: Guys, I have been working on a BGE model (based on BERT) for fine-tuning it to my domain specific data.
But my domain data contains Hinglish tokens as well (like pyaaz, adrak, amchur), which the model doesn‚Äôt includes in the vocab as I am doing fine-tuning and not doing any pre-training.

Resultantly, the model doesn‚Äôt capture the things well, and it has disturbed the model‚Äôs performance and some previous good tasks.

Do you guys think, it makes sense to do some pretraining to increase the vocab? Or should I focus on fine-tuning details only?

It‚Äôs not out of the box, you need to tweak prompts, have a nice dataset/rag, have some few shots of the final response you expect. 

An llm is like a black box it needs considerable tweaking to do the magic.

6/20/24, 17:18 - +91 98300 16577: thios is the features of the trading execution bot i have created 
Overview of the Threshold Breakup/Breakdown Bot
Purpose:
The bot is designed to monitor the price of an asset (in this case, a specific instrument identified by instrument_token) and execute trades when certain threshold conditions are met. The bot aims to capitalize on price movements by placing orders when prices cross predefined upper or lower thresholds and exhibit specific behaviors.

Detailed Explanation
1. Initial Setup:
API Initialization: The bot uses the Kite Connect API to interact with the trading platform. API credentials (api_key, api_secret, and access_token) are required to authenticate and access market data.
User Input: The bot prompts the user to input the initial upper and lower threshold levels, the quantity of the asset to trade (in multiples of 15), and the update interval for the thresholds.
2. Threshold Monitoring and Trading Logic:
Variables Initialization: Several flags and counters are initialized to keep track of price movements and trade conditions:

upper_crossed, lower_crossed, upper_retested, lower_retested, upper_bounced, lower_bounced: Flags indicating the status of price movements relative to the thresholds.
ce_repetitions_counter, pe_repetitions_counter: Counters for conditions met before executing a trade.
ce_condition_met, pe_condition_met: Flags indicating if conditions for a Call Option (CE) or Put Option (PE) trade are met.
bounce_time: The time when the price bounced off the threshold.
previous_price: The last recorded price.
ce_trigger_point, pe_trigger_point: Trigger points for executing CE or PE trades.
Main Monitoring Loop: The bot continuously monitors the price in a loop:

Price Fetching: The bot fetches the latest price using the kite.quote method.
Threshold Logic: The bot checks if the price crosses, retests, or bounces off the upper or lower thresholds and updates the flags accordingly.
Trade Execution Logic: If the conditions for a trade are met (e.g., price bounces off a threshold and stays within the specified range for a certain time), the bot places a trade order using the kite.place_order method.
3. Order Placement and Trade Conditions:
Strike Price Calculation: The bot calculates the strike price for the options to be traded based on the last price and the type of option (CE or PE).
Order Placement: The bot places a buy order for the calculated strike price when the conditions are met.
Trade Conditions Analysis: The bot includes functions to analyze the market conditions before placing a trade:
Trade Condition Analysis: The bot analyzes the trend over the last few periods to determine if a significant portion of the candles are bullish (for CE) or bearish (for PE).
Slope Condition Analysis: The bot calculates the slope and curvature of the price trend to determine the overall trend direction.
High/Low Condition Analysis: The bot examines the high and low prices over a specified lookback period to identify significant price points.
4. Updating Thresholds:
The bot periodically prompts the user to update the upper and lower thresholds and resets the relevant flags and counters when the thresholds are updated.
Key Functions:
get_threshold_and_qty(): Prompts the user for initial threshold levels, quantity, and update interval.
monitor_price_and_trade(): Monitors the price and executes trades based on threshold conditions.
calculate_strike_price(): Calculates the strike price for options.
place_order(): Places a trade order.
trade_condition(): Analyzes market conditions to determine if a trade should be placed.
slope_condition(): Analyzes the slope and curvature of price trends.
high_low_condition(): Examines high and low price points over a lookback period.
fetch_and_print_order_details(): Fetches and prints details of a placed order.

6/22/24, 21:53 - +44 7404 656243: I transfer straight into account (via wise)
6/22/24, 21:53 - +44 7404 656243: Using upi or bank details
6/22/24, 22:05 - +91 88585 06876: Same here, both for accepting and sending
6/22/24, 22:19 - +91 98104 85533: How much does wise charge ?

6/22/24, 22:55 - +91 88873 00821: I'm using wise too. PayPal sucks.

Also I've been using stripe for SaaS and invoicing. Got $1k fee off via student discount.
6/23/24, 11:39 - +91 90746 83618: Oh nice but few months ago I checked that wise has limitations to create new account?
6/23/24, 13:07 - +91 88873 00821: You need to have a business account to accept payments in India. Personal one doesn't allow to accept payments.

If you've got an entity then good. Otherwise just get a sole proprietorship firm registered.
6/23/24, 14:08 - +91 96001 46419: Skydo or mulya. Skydo for small payments and mulya for larger ones
6/23/24, 14:09 - +91 96001 46419: Skydo is transparent and very simple to use in my opinion and has flat fee structure for larger payments + invoice generation, email alerts, local bank accounts etc. <This message was edited>

6/28/24, 14:49 - +91 96647 15556: Hello Guys!!

About 60000 quizzes are built on our platform and most of them are in Gujarati language. Now, we want to create "Semantic Search" to search our quizzes. To prepare this Search we have used bert, m-bert, Indic bert, pragna-1b, OpenAI embedding and few other embedding models but they do not give good performance for Gujarati language and do not get enough accuracy.

So can anyone tell me what step should I take now?
6/28/24, 15:04 - +91 90052 36891: Question Did you fine-tune any of these models on gujrati dataset?
Gujrati content in pretrained model's dataset might be very low
6/28/24, 15:05 - +91 90052 36891: 1. What and how much dataset you have?
2. What  do you mean by low accuracy? Model cannot ranking documents or cannot given to particular quiz question
3. Did you try simpler models like fasttext or even tried with BM25 indexes?
6/28/24, 15:07 - +91 90052 36891: 4. How are you using semantic system? Like you are doing some filtering of 1000s of documents to few 10s of running semantic search for all the 1000s of doc directly?
6/28/24, 15:10 - +91 96647 15556: No. We have not fine-tuned the model but have tried pre-trained model that have been created for Indian languages.
6/28/24, 15:11 - +91 96647 15556: 1. We did not fine tune the model
2. ‚Å†yes, Model cannot ranking documents or cannot given to particular quiz question
6/28/24, 15:46 - +91 63622 60992: What kind of quizzes? I'm just curious

I needed some advice regarding a company that collaborates with students on research papers. It's basically free of cost. And they'll provide a mentor for me that'll write the paper with me. In return I just need to put their name as co author(totally valid). Is there anything I should be cautious of? Like get them to sign something before starting the paper? Like I feel like I don't have anything on the idea of they choose to not include me in writing at some point in time.
7/6/24, 17:06 - +91 63794 73054: this has been considered a scam

Additionally, what methods or frameworks are available to develop benchmarks for custom RAG systems?
7/7/24, 21:17 - +91 81065 57775: Would love to know as well.
7/7/24, 21:23 - +91 97171 56090: There is no easy pill here. Do some hard work. Look at some data, annotate it using a tool like argilla, build an eval set for the metrics you care about, use existing NLP metrics like accuracy, Rouge, BLEU, etc if they align with your requirements. if your metrics are too complex or the criteria is subjective, define an LLM-as-a-judge and use your annotations as few shot examples to build an llm based evaluator. Trace your llm calls, use weave by w&b, or langsmith or giskard or other observability frameworks to look at your prompts, outputs and evals. Use frameworks like Ragas, deepeval, langchain or llama-index to run evals and iterate multiple times to gain confidence over your evaluations.
7/7/24, 21:36 - +91 90746 83618: Thank you for the comprehensive response, and is there any observation on long context open models vs Rag? Any benchmark?
7/7/24, 22:12 - +91 90746 83618: By the way, I am exploring the RAFT method, which demonstrates outstanding performance compared to simple RAG, domain-specific models combined with RAG, and other approaches. Has anyone tried the RAFT model and evaluated its performance?
7/7/24, 23:05 - +91 99712 24643: I'm evaluating it. The only issue I have is it's suited for domain adaptation tasks. RAG serves a purpose that can go beyond domain adaptation.
7/7/24, 23:11 - +91 90746 83618: Interesting, what usecase and how are you evaluating raft? And did you use llamaindex package to create dataset for raft?
7/7/24, 23:18 - +91 99712 24643: I have a bouquet of use cases like function calling, brand voice, code generation, etc. this approach is only suitable for domain adaptation. I'm creating a synthetic dataset manually, might not go ahead with this. 

I feel there are no shortcuts here, human labelling is a tough one to beat.
7/7/24, 23:22 - +91 90746 83618: If you have those usecases then definitely you shouldn't go with this, your model requires mostly diverse set of instructions fine-tuning rather than same set of instructions as suggested in the raft paper. <This message was edited>

7/10/24, 09:22 - +91 90031 35354: much of the current generative AI space looking for mass scale user adoption relies on one to be more inquisitive , to explore more creative ideas, to seek answers to everything. But the common human on an average are habituated not to be constantly inquisitive, creative or seeking answers. For generative AI to see mass adoption first it has to change this habit at a billion user scale. Chatgpt was one step in that direction but it will take time. How many of us here in this group, creamy layer, highly  inquisitive, creative ppl use some form of gen AI daily for some personal needs (not office related) ? I am sure not too many. And we expect the average joe to use AI daily?

Till habit changes, AI will mostly find its large scale utility within existing workflows. Now whether that is a sustainable adoption rate is a big question. on top of that there is the problem of hallucinations and inaccuracies.

So my reading is AI space is walking on a knife edge at the moment. Its definitely not hype, but it's also not the mobile phone or internet or electricity or steam engine yet.

Fortran is my fav language for this üòÇ c will also work.. not sure of python
7/10/24, 13:26 - +91 96001 46419: Each stone here should have 5mm diameter. We need to detect stones that exceed 5mm diameter
7/10/24, 13:26 - +91 96001 46419: And stop the process if it exceeds 15% of overall stones in given period of time
7/10/24, 13:32 - +91 96001 46419: So it should ideally work in hig res images and decent fps speed
7/10/24, 13:32 - +91 96001 46419: Algorithm is not an issue. I can write it. Need the cheapest camera or atleast any camera that can handle this fps
7/10/24, 13:32 - +91 88585 06876: how is it done right now?
7/10/24, 13:33 - +91 96001 46419: Haha don't ask
7/10/24, 13:33 - +91 96001 46419: Manually
7/10/24, 13:33 - +91 88585 06876: so someone with great eyesight has to capture the stones that appear bigger than 5mm  diameter?
7/10/24, 13:35 - +91 88585 06876: if you could use a mechanical eye with AI in the background that would solve the problem. Is this what you are trying to achieve?
7/10/24, 13:37 - +91 96001 46419: They check occasionally manually so they don't get correct values. Just saying vaguely with binary yes / no
7/10/24, 13:37 - +91 96001 46419: Needs a lot of improvement
7/10/24, 13:38 - +91 96001 46419: Mechanical eye? Any links?
7/10/24, 13:38 - +91 96001 46419: Hearing for first time
7/10/24, 13:39 - +91 88585 06876: I used mechanical eye as a synonym for camera, sorry üòÖ
7/10/24, 13:40 - +91 91132 06642: I think a mesh with a filter diameter of 4.99mm should work right ?
7/10/24, 13:44 - +91 88585 06876: yeah that is the manual approach
7/10/24, 13:45 - +91 88585 06876: What would yo do once you identify the stones with bigger diameter? For eg: when you do it manually do you remove it? or just stop the process. ALso this video must be real time streaming?
7/10/24, 13:45 - +91 88585 06876: so process can be stoped as sson as there is a issue?
7/10/24, 13:45 - +91 88585 06876: have you thought of infra red mesh or something
7/10/24, 13:45 - +91 88585 06876: just brainstorming here brother
7/10/24, 13:59 - +33 6 02 50 62 73: My mechanical engineering is kicking in , why do you need ai for this .. just make the stones fall on a sheet with a hole of 5mm , make one with minimum and other with maximum tolerance and mechanically filter it out.. the quality guys will thank you for it.. every time you use ai or electronics in production you get a lot of downtime üòÇ
7/10/24, 14:04 - +91 98300 16577: Any WhatsApp group for hardware systems for ai ?
7/10/24, 14:13 - +91 90031 35354: This is the simplest yet most cost effective solution
7/10/24, 14:38 - +91 96001 46419: Was in control room couldn't reply. Yes that's exactly what is happening behind the scenes. The sheet with hole is not working as this video is output of that screen with holes
7/10/24, 14:39 - +91 96001 46419: They replace the sheet like filtering if it exceeds certain amount <This message was edited>

7/19/24, 17:00 - +91 90746 83618: Let's discuss some production aspects of building RAG and fine-tuned models. Here are some observations and thoughts:

1) Long-form evaluation for RAG-based systems can be unreliable. For more information, see this Cohere blog post: https://cohere.com/blog/evaluating-llm-outputs
2) Using an LLM as a judge is a viable option, but its effectiveness depends on several factors:

a) The prompt used
b) Few-shot examples provided
c) The specific model chosen
d) Who evaluates the LLM output (which remains an open question)
7/19/24, 17:01 - +91 90746 83618: I've been considering the following evaluation framework. Please share your insights on whether this makes sense:

We need to verify model output in two aspects:
a) Factual accuracy
b) Readability and coherence etc

*Proposed approach:*

Convert existing questions into multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with ground-truth answers and explanations.
Evaluation process:

1) For MCQs, there's always one factual answer, simplifying the evaluation.
2) When asking for the correct MCQ answer, also request an explanation. This allows us to compare [model explanation, ground truth explanation] using an LLM as a judge, providing insights into other metrics.

Share your opinions, Do you have any suggestions or improvements for this framework?

I am honored to be part of this journey with you all. 

At 50GRAMx Networks, we have been working on creating a stable resource and processing network for AI training and inference through Ethos Nodes and Ethos Pods. As some of you experienced during our demo in April, we are making significant progress.

We are seeking your participation to further solve the challenges faced by AI developers and companies. 

I would like to share two opportunities with you:
1. Earn sustainable income by sharing your GPU/CPU resources through Ethos Nodes.
2. Utilize our open network for AI training and inference using VMs with Dockerfile and Pods with Managed Clusters across regions (currently for non-sensitive information).

If you are interested in being a part of this movement, please let me know. Thank you and have a great day!

We're looking for a freelance React developer with experience in API development.

Company: LiaPlus.com (seed funded)
Location: Noida, Delhi NCR
Industry: Gen AI/Conversational AI
Duration: 1 month 

Checkout the job description here: jobs.liaplus.com

To apply, send CV to: Shailesh Jaiswal - wa.me/919205066063
8/13/24, 09:59 - +91 63695 89236: The conern is valid and common but can be easily solved. 

The issue arises because the following is not handlded as a part of the RAG /GEN AI project implementation. 

How to address conerns about prompt injection: 
1. Access management planning whereby the answer generated from LLM is not used to change any system configurations/write to database (except for saving the text/image/video that is generated)
2. Using and agentic framework to: 
	1. check if the users prompt has any malicious content
	2. check if the output genrated by the LLM (GEN AI)  satisfies the criteria required
	3. Alert system and user/ip based blocking in case of any malicious activity detected
3. using locally hosted LLM which is pretrained to handle malicious attacks <This message was edited>

8/13/24, 10:02 - +91 88585 06876: Thanks for honouring the friendship @916369589236 you have always been so supportive.
8/13/24, 10:26 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): This is a major issue with llm applications. And i think we are just one major attack away on any big players when everyone will start focussing on prompt injection.

There are already major players working on this. 
https://protectai.com/llm-guard 
https://promptarmor.com/

Open source: 
https://github.com/protectai/rebuff
https://github.com/greshake/llm-security - this is just analysis

You can find more. Usually all these should be python packages that can be added as an upper layer to your llm application, that morphs/rejects the prompt with vulnerability. 

But @916369589236 is right, having a fine tuned model for your usecase will work good as well. <This message was edited>

8/22/24, 18:34 - +91 79021 67879: Use Unstructured or Llamaparse
HTML paresers from Llamaindex and Langchain are pretty useless 
They just split by tags
8/22/24, 18:42 - +91 76174 06350: yeah, I did scrapping & chunking for my customer support (by chatgpt) product.
8/22/24, 18:44 - +91 76174 06350: yes, simple parsers are useless. instead of converting html to plain text, it should be converted to markdown format to preserve content hierarchy.
8/22/24, 18:46 - +91 90052 36891: Yes actually can try
 html to md to llm to json
There are many html to md converters for simple cases
8/22/24, 18:51 - +91 76174 06350: when html tables are converted to plain text, they become unreadable garbage. MD maintains table structures too.

I am already tried doing these, still the quality of response when tryin to use api functions on a loop with same system prompt but different user prompts seems to be reducing the quaility. Have you or anyone else faced such issues? How do you manage processing of large text inputs? segmentation is not working for consecutive invocations.
8/27/24, 20:59 - +91 63695 89236: Same issue
8/27/24, 21:14 - +91 96001 46419: Used to chunk it but lately using long context models as I see them becoming more prevalent in future
8/27/24, 21:47 - +91 88585 06876: Interesting, i am using chunking  with structured output in json. Have you noticed improvement in results with long context models?

I'm an individual developer currently working on various Large Language Models (LLMs) and I'm facing a bottleneck in terms of computational resources. To scale up my projects and accelerate training times, I require additional GPU power.

Could you please recommend the best platform among Google Colab, Kaggle, and Hugging Face for my needs? I'd appreciate detailed insights into:

- GPU specifications and availability
- Pricing plans and cost-effectiveness
- Ease of use and integration with my existing workflow
- Community support and resources

9/10/24, 13:46 - +91 63695 89236: what about using with claude composer
9/10/24, 13:48 - +91 73877 90163: Composer?
9/10/24, 13:48 - +91 73877 90163: You mean artifacts?
9/10/24, 14:01 - +91 63695 89236: Sorry typo. 

I mean Cursor composer and chat
9/10/24, 14:14 - +91 91082 87982: can we use a local model with cursor?
9/10/24, 14:14 - +91 91082 87982: tried claude dev its freaking out with llama3.1
9/10/24, 14:18 - +91 73877 90163: Yup composer mode is really cool
9/10/24, 14:18 - +91 73877 90163: No maybe
9/10/24, 16:59 - +91 89087 56505: claude 3.5 Sonnet
9/10/24, 17:01 - +91 89087 56505: but sometimes gpt 4o gives a better result, when there is long context, claude kinda skips few lines of code while generating in the chat window
9/10/24, 17:04 - +91 99100 82369: I think for local models your best bet is to use Aider, although I'm yet to try it
9/10/24, 17:04 - +91 88103 86510: For price, deepseek-2.5
9/10/24, 17:04 - +91 88103 86510: Almost comparable to sonnet 3.5
9/10/24, 17:05 - +91 99100 82369: Been using Cursor for a week and it's really good
9/10/24, 17:05 - +91 99100 82369: Also tried v0 by Vercel, really good for front end use cases
9/10/24, 17:05 - +91 63695 89236: Thanks
9/10/24, 17:05 - +91 63695 89236: Oh thanks!
9/10/24, 17:06 - +91 63695 89236: Can advise what use cases were better on v0 compared to cursor.
9/10/24, 17:06 - +91 88103 86510: Yes, those are amazing for web apps
9/10/24, 17:06 - +91 88103 86510: Also did you try replit agent? It's üî•
9/10/24, 17:09 - +91 90009 94891: V0 seems to know the latest conventions like the nextjs app router and common ui lib like shadcn better (as all these are close to Vercel) than both Claude/ChatGPT
9/10/24, 17:10 - +91 63695 89236: Noted thanks
9/10/24, 18:32 - +91 63695 89236: can anyone help me with claude sonnet api key, want to use it with cursor IDE. i can pay you upfront on bank account or upi? thanks! please pm me.
9/10/24, 19:01 - +91 88103 86510: Why don't you use openrouter? You can use any model from there
9/10/24, 19:17 - +91 81065 57775: Or you can use Continue with Ollama with local models.
9/10/24, 19:21 - +91 91082 87982: What model works best?
9/10/24, 19:22 - +91 81065 57775: I tried with codellama. Didn't experiment a lot. But works decently
9/10/24, 19:27 - +91 96730 79924: There are some good models available on ollama.
It's performs decent because of quantization of models.
You can try mixtral,  llama and also llama3.1 which is updated one.
9/10/24, 19:28 - +91 91082 87982: I tried llama3.1 did a really shitty job
9/10/24, 19:32 - +91 96730 79924: I haven't tried llama3.1 yet , 
But for experiment , I had good results using mistral
9/10/24, 20:54 - +91 63695 89236: I am trying this in cursor ide not sure if open router will work
9/10/24, 21:16 - +91 88103 86510: It should, openrouter api format is same as openai. But seems like cursor has some issues https://forum.cursor.com/t/if-i-add-openrouter-it-says-the-provided-api-key-is-invalid/5958
9/10/24, 21:16 - +91 88103 86510: There aren't any good local models
9/10/24, 21:16 - +91 88103 86510: You can try using codeium, it is free and much better than alternatives like GitHub copilot
9/10/24, 21:22 - +91 63695 89236: Yes i saw those hence requested here
9/11/24, 06:03 - +91 96001 46419: Hi

10/2/24, 21:52 - +91 88103 86510: I would recommend that first try lora training (search for qlora) for practice before full fine-tuning. It will be much faster and cheaper.
10/2/24, 21:53 - +91 88103 86510: Try searching for existing benchmarks which are close to the desired domain and see rankings of different llms in that specific benchmark. Select one from there, as that may have better quality.

10/4/24, 17:46 - +91 94499 47496: Simple questions, I'm doing a survey:
1. Have you used amazon ec2 before?
2. Have you used docker compose before?
3. Have you used kubernetes before?

If yes to all three, what do you feel most comfortable with?
10/4/24, 17:52 - +91 93108 16452: Yes to all. They are all used for different purposes. But to answer your question Kubernetes is most reliable and easy to use but hard to understand and setup
10/4/24, 17:59 - +91 94499 47496: Why is it easy to use ?
10/4/24, 17:59 - +91 94499 47496: How is it easy to use?
10/4/24, 18:08 - +91 93108 16452: Because it provides a lot of inbuilt features like self healing, monitoring, logging, deployment management, upgrades mechanisms, load balancing, and helm charts to name a few <This message was edited>
10/4/24, 18:09 - +91 94499 47496: Those are features.
10/4/24, 18:10 - +91 94499 47496: Doesn‚Äôt not mean it‚Äôs easy to use.
10/4/24, 18:10 - +91 94499 47496: Do you use it?
10/4/24, 18:11 - +91 93108 16452: These features make it easy to manage the whole system. Otherwise you will have to implement them on your own
10/4/24, 18:11 - +91 93108 16452: Yes
10/4/24, 18:20 - +91 94499 47496: Nice.

10/5/24, 08:10 - +91 7397 360 520: Then countries like China and India where there is less regulation would overtake bay area
10/5/24, 08:22 - +91 7397 360 520: I could use some help here. I'm building a simple SaaS related to Webflow (no fancy AI features yet) and I'm using NextJS with the help of AI. I'm trying to figure out the best payment solution.

I've hit a few roadblocks so far:

Stripe doesn't seem to be available where I'm located - India.
Lemon Squeezy's photo/document verification didn't work for me
Paddle is still processing my application after a few weeks
Tried this new processor called creem.io, but unavailable in India.

I've considered a few other options, but they all seem to have issues:

Forming an e-residency business in Estonia to use Stripe, but that requires in-person verification to Delhi + the verification could take 3 months, then business formation durations.
Tried Bizee for fast business formation and Stripe integration, but they want some kind of ID number if you're not a US resident, which is another 3-month process as its process on the government side. I remember reading there is also no Guarantee on that. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or experience with reliable, accessible payment solutions? I'm really struggling to find a good option that doesn't involve a ton of red tape and delays. Any advice would be super helpful!
10/5/24, 08:25 - +91 99606 43970: razorpay
10/5/24, 08:25 - +91 99606 43970: also why Estonia
10/5/24, 08:27 - +91 7397 360 520: I heard that anyone can apply for e-residency program and starting a business there is easy. 

It‚Äôs still straight forward but I have to travel to Delhi and wait for 3 months + few more weeks for busienss. 

And heard some positive things about the tax policy.
10/5/24, 08:28 - +91 99606 43970: Do share more details if you go through with it
10/5/24, 08:30 - +91 7397 360 520: I have 2 concerns 

1) I‚Äôm a no code developer.. will AI be able to generate razorpay related code.. because I was relying trial and error with AI generate code - My app contains like 6 screens and 1 copying and filter functionality functionality. 

2) Will people be fine to pay with razorpay.. since webflow tool is primarily used outside India, will people hesitate to pay via razorpay as they are familiar with stripe etc.
10/5/24, 08:32 - +91 99606 43970: And razorpay API is easy to set and use . Verification process is simple and fast . Many micro SaaS that I know of are using it . Start with it and integrate more options as your verification completes. You can also try PayPal ( but cuts are high ) and strip holds the payment so do check all recent reviews before going for it . Lemon squeeze make it from accounting perspective
10/5/24, 08:33 - +91 7397 360 520: okay, I will apply for Razorpay today. Unsure if the approval team works on Sat/Sunday. But lets see
10/5/24, 08:33 - +91 99606 43970: To part one it‚Äôs a simple API integration , which AI can handle
10/5/24, 08:33 - +91 7397 360 520: This message was deleted
10/5/24, 08:34 - +91 7397 360 520: Any thoughts on people‚Äôs hesitation if they‚Äôre not seeing stripe checkout in saas.. as its usually the defacto checkout..
10/5/24, 08:34 - +91 99606 43970: Not that I‚Äôm aware of
10/5/24, 08:35 - +91 99606 43970: But do note I was running a business till 2023 and my target audience was different
10/5/24, 08:36 - +91 7397 360 520: I see, and Razorpay was fine without any problems?
10/5/24, 08:36 - +91 99606 43970: Yes
10/5/24, 08:36 - +91 7397 360 520: That‚Äôs good to hear
10/5/24, 10:44 - +91 77950 01900: AFAIK Razorpay will only allow settlement in Indian bank account. Given that your business is based in Estonia, not sure if Razorpay is the right solution for you.
10/5/24, 10:54 - +91 99606 43970: He‚Äôs setting up in Estonia but not setup still
10/5/24, 10:54 - +91 99606 43970: Later on lemon squeeze will be best bet considering taxes
10/5/24, 10:57 - +91 7397 360 520: My English it not that good so if I didn‚Äôt convey it clearly my bad, I‚Äôm in India only.. I considered options of Estonia/USA to setup business.
10/5/24, 10:59 - +91 77950 01900: My bad, you had mentioned it quite clearly

10/6/24, 23:43 - +44 7404 656243: which is best extraction library for RAG - either open source or self hostable
unstructured.io seems promising but just takes too long or crashes often
What other state of the art options are out there ?
10/6/24, 23:43 - +91 88397 34883: Spam ü•≤
10/6/24, 23:45 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): Unstructured io, has fast mode as well, 


What is the use case? Like are the documents of particular types, tabular data, non tabular data etc?
10/6/24, 23:50 - +44 7404 656243: yes tables are common. charts too - but even if we leave the charts along for now
10/6/24, 23:51 - +91 95501 64716: did you try llamaparse?
10/6/24, 23:51 - +44 7404 656243: llamaparse is not self hostable ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/6/24, 23:54 - +91 95501 64716: oh yeah true
10/6/24, 23:55 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): For tables unstructured was great, and the latency was also low. 

There were other open source options, but unstructured was consistent for me.

Parsing the output into a table from json was also easy
10/6/24, 23:56 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): There were other open sourced options based on suryaOCR model
10/6/24, 23:56 - +44 7404 656243: Ok
10/6/24, 23:57 - +44 7404 656243: Thanks i have reached out to their support as their hosted solution does not work at all

also tries to spam us (laudable effort).
10/10/24, 15:31 - +62 857-9556-9424: Okay friends, if that's the case, I also use English because it's an international language, why do I use the local language? Because in the Turkish group, if you use a foreign language it's not accepted, you have to use the local language.
10/10/24, 15:32 - +91 63695 89236: i am just joking. use whatever language. but not appreciate to spam us directly without enganging/contributing. i think its ok to share work ask for help.

And to some below answers..

Since I also have plan to sell my saas down the line.. I was informed if the payment processor was an international one.. it would be easy.

And, after going through which countries allows quick and affordable business formation for resident (so I can access stripe) 

I'm considering UK. There are many providers who are very affordable.

Seems the formation procedures are quick.

Any advice on this?

_AI is much more than image generation and smart-sounding chatbots; it‚Äôs also a Nobel-worthy endeavor rooted in physics!_

The idea of neural network indeed came to fruition first as the result of physics studies across three disciplines -- biophysics, statistical physics, and computational physics - all fused together.

10/12/24, 17:12 - +91 97246 54616: *Can AI Revolutionize Medicine, Solve Hunger, and Double Lifespans?*

_Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei just dropped a bold, 15,000-word essay packed with his optimistic vision for AI‚Äôs future and he‚Äôs betting it‚Äôll change everything._

Here‚Äôs a look at Amodei‚Äôs tech-fueled dream of a world transformed by AI.

Key Takeaways from Amodei‚Äôs Vision
AI as a World-Changer: Amodei believes ‚Äúpowerful AI‚Äù could be here by 2026, smarter than Nobel Prize winners in fields like biology and engineering. 

This AI would:

- Solve complex tasks like theorem-proofing, medical research, and industrial operations.

- Handle most human jobs better and faster than people, even without physical embodiment.

- Medical and Scientific Breakthroughs: Within the next decade, Amodei predicts AI could:

- Cure infectious diseases, treat genetic disorders, and even halt Alzheimer‚Äôs in early stages.

- Tackle mental health issues, developing AI-concocted drugs to address PTSD, depression, and more.

- Potentially double the average human lifespan, accelerating progress in biology that could take 100 years into just 10.

Global Problem-Solving Potential: 

Amodei envisions AI addressing major world issues, including:

- Hunger eradication and climate change mitigation.

- Boosting GDP in developing nations like sub-Saharan Africa to levels seen in wealthier countries.

- Empowering democratic nations to regulate AI‚Äôs ethical use and prevent misuse by adversaries.

Challenges and Realities: 

Even with these sweeping predictions, Amodei acknowledges:

- The AI and robotics industries would need unprecedented advances to reach these goals.

- A global shift in priorities toward collective benefit‚Äîunusual in practice‚Äîwould be essential.

- AI faces hurdles in reasoning, bias, environmental impact, and ethical management that remain unsolved.

What‚Äôs Behind the Timing?

While Amodei‚Äôs enthusiasm is clear, the timing of the essay raises questions.

Anthropic, valued at nearly $40 billion, is reportedly seeking major investment, and the essay echoes similar optimistic pitches from other AI leaders.

While Amodei envisions AI as a world-saver, this manifesto may also be a strategic pitch to investors eager to back ‚Äúworld-changing‚Äù tech. 

Smart move if you ask me.

10/14/24, 13:54 - +44 7404 656243: Yes the one with multi modal embeddings. i think it will be more accurate but not sure about indexing time. 
I'll test it this week
10/14/24, 13:57 - Sidhhant (Gen AI): yes, indexng might be a concern, Would love to get your insights on the results.
10/14/24, 13:57 - +44 7404 656243: Will keep you posted

Good at high level conceptual thinking to come up with detailed product description but post that I work with sonnet and v0 for code (don't use O1 or O1 mini for code)

Given an audio for a reel and ask to generate concise 10-15 picture descriptions which I then put in ideogram for making pictures.

It's really good at high level conceptual thinking compared to gpt 4 or claude models.

Just identify what was lacking and go again
10/20/24, 17:40 - +91 63695 89236: Missing ux /ui and marketing. Backend is ready. 

Marketing I can still do but need someone for front end
10/20/24, 17:41 - +44 7404 656243: Hire someone then. We have many ux ui frontend developers around
10/20/24, 17:42 - +91 63695 89236: Time is lacking due to full time job. I grew my business unit from 0 to 1 million arr in 3 years. So business side I'm confident product side I'm missing a driver /hustler. Anyone want to join, pm me

10/20/24, 18:00 - +91 63695 89236: Thanks for support bro really appreciate it
10/20/24, 19:07 - +91 62393 05919: Hello everyone, could anyone tell me what things do I need to learn to build AI SAAS products. Right now I have good hold over ML, DL and GENAI. But building dummy things using streamlit.
10/20/24, 19:08 - +91 62393 05919: I am asking here because I guess there might be some individuals who might be building end to end products. So anyone guidance or suggestions will help a lot.
10/20/24, 19:35 - +91 88397 34883: Looks like your skills are very domain specific, building products alone means you have to be jack of all trades
10/20/24, 19:35 - +91 88397 34883: You need to learn one Frontend library and some backend development
10/20/24, 19:36 - +91 88397 34883: Unless your product has very high value proposition getting people to pay for streamlit app is hard
10/20/24, 19:36 - +91 62393 05919: Yes I am aiming for that only,  and ready to put in hours. I just need to know what exact things are used because in internet things are very general and vague
10/20/24, 19:36 - +91 62393 05919: Yes yes
10/20/24, 19:37 - +91 88397 34883: Do a general full stack course, pick some freelance projects
10/20/24, 19:37 - +91 88397 34883: I guess you are using python
10/20/24, 19:37 - +91 88397 34883: So on backend side go with a python backend
10/20/24, 19:37 - +91 62393 05919: Yes I am using python
10/20/24, 19:38 - +91 62393 05919: Okay
10/20/24, 19:38 - +91 88397 34883: On frontend side go with react or vue; there are other frameworks too but you'll get good community support with these two
10/20/24, 19:39 - +91 88397 34883: Btw there is a way to sell streamlit apps too ü§î if you can add a paywall to your app
10/20/24, 19:39 - +91 97898 20475: Flask will be easy for starters
10/20/24, 19:40 - +44 7404 656243: Try to find a problem people are ready to pay for to solve
Then it should not matter if its a stramlit app or a more compex one. Just focus on finding those users first
10/20/24, 19:40 - +91 88397 34883: But that won't be very scalable
10/20/24, 19:40 - +91 88397 34883: üèÖ
10/20/24, 19:40 - +91 62393 05919: Yes but I wanted to learn how to build like good end to end product. Even though adding a paywall to streamlit could would work.
10/20/24, 19:40 - +44 7404 656243: Dont worry about scaling on day 1. You are not even at day 1 yet
10/20/24, 19:40 - +91 62393 05919: Okay okay
10/20/24, 19:41 - +44 7404 656243: You have to be clear if you want to learn or want to build an ai saas
10/20/24, 19:41 - +91 62393 05919: I want to build
10/20/24, 19:41 - +44 7404 656243: Both can happen but you goal has to be clear
10/20/24, 19:41 - +44 7404 656243: Just do it in my opinion you can build and sell streamlit apps <This message was edited>
10/20/24, 19:42 - +91 88397 34883: I guess he wants to do both
10/20/24, 19:42 - +44 7404 656243: Thats ok but there has to be a primary goal
10/20/24, 19:43 - +91 62393 05919: Yes I am just looking to know what frontend tech and backend tech I need to learn to build the product.
10/20/24, 19:43 - +44 7404 656243: Go with one which you already know or is easy forn you o pick up
10/20/24, 19:43 - +91 88397 34883: Do you have any idea in mind? I can help you validate it with minimum efforts
10/20/24, 19:43 - +91 62393 05919: As even though streamlit could do the things. But I am highly motivated to create an end to end product
10/20/24, 19:44 - +44 7404 656243: Nextjs is good and easy
10/20/24, 19:44 - +91 62393 05919: I don't have the specific idea it's like I have been doing freelance and giving solution with streamlit. But I was thinking to level up a bit and get high quality projects
10/20/24, 19:44 - +91 88397 34883: I have seen many people using it for backend too; hosting it on vercel and it's still pretty cheap and quick to build
10/20/24, 19:44 - +91 62393 05919: Okay thankyou so much
10/20/24, 19:45 - +91 88397 34883: This is a very good track
10/20/24, 19:45 - +91 88397 34883: Just look if one of these streamlit apps have a broader audience
10/20/24, 19:45 - +91 62393 05919: Okay okay
10/20/24, 19:46 - +91 88397 34883: I once built a govt contracts scraping tool for a client
10/20/24, 19:46 - +91 88397 34883: I found similar clients
10/20/24, 19:46 - +91 88397 34883: Sold them the same tool with minimal modification
10/20/24, 19:47 - +91 88397 34883: Going from services to product is a good path
10/20/24, 19:56 - +91 90290 81083: U can start with no code front end apps like bubble.io to test if people are willing to pay... Later on add a better ui/ux
10/20/24, 19:58 - +91 62393 05919: Oh okay okay, thanks for suggesting
10/20/24, 20:20 - +91 99580 07011: If you guys are looking for something quick to build for front ends especially when you have python on the backend, look into alpinejs and htmx. 

If anyone uses django, here is something that‚Äôs built using the same stack https://unfoldadmin.com/

This gives you the best of both worlds, newer css advancements like tailwind while giving the flexibility of templates. <This message was edited>
10/20/24, 20:21 - +91 99580 07011: Here is a five part tutorial on learning how to build using this stack https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/modern-javascript-for-django-developers/htmx-alpine/

10/20/24, 20:25 - +91 99580 07011: Also would highly recommend using https://v0.dev to get quick prototypes. And if you use this stack it will give out good looking useable components that you can import with htmx.

2. People who realise how miraculous everyday world is
10/20/24, 21:50 - +91 88397 34883: Besides that don't take it too seriously, you can prompt it to say religious things too

10/20/24, 22:29 - +91 88397 34883: Add 1-2 questions about geeta or advaita
10/20/24, 22:30 - +91 88397 34883: It'll start talking like a religious guru
10/21/24, 00:09 - +91 63695 89236: This is not real ai per se. It's generative ai (a large language model). It is is just regurgitating the condensed form of information published on the Internet.

This reminds me when I was younger I read the wikipedia entry on bhagavad gita and it said bhagavad gita was written 500 years ago. I was shocked because that time I was naive enough to blindly trust wikipedia.

But when I switched to llama 8b 4bit quantization and llama 70b 4bit quantization the model hallucinates more and it's not even calling the functions and not moving to other agents too 

Any fix for this or any other gud model for this?

10/25/24, 10:44 - +91 63695 89236: Good question.
10/25/24, 13:05 - +91 97898 20475: I have an image vector database with over 40,000 images, and I'm also performing metadata filtering. So far, there hasn‚Äôt been an issue with response times.

The client‚Äôs question is whether adding more images to the vector database will slow down response times or impact search capabilities. I am using ChromaDB with the OpenCLIPEmbeddingFunction.
10/25/24, 13:05 - +91 97898 20475: Pls answer

Thanks
10/25/24, 13:05 - +91 97898 20475: Their will be minimum 8 images as a response
10/25/24, 13:10 - +91 7397 360 520: ChromaDB is designed to handle large-scale vector searches efficiently, so scaling from 40K to even 100K images shouldn't significantly impact response times when fetching 8 results ‚Äì especially since you're already successfully handling metadata filtering üëç Just ensure you're using SSD storage to maintain optimal performance as you grow.
10/25/24, 13:11 - +91 7397 360 520: Any other thoughts on this also welecomed :) Please correct me if I'm wrng

I wanted to try for 5 minute and it seems very expensive (relative to Indian earnings)
11/8/24, 16:41 - +91 63695 89236: Just use replicate.
11/8/24, 16:42 - +91 63695 89236: Flux lora or stable diffusion.

11/8/24, 16:51 - +91 81044 28406: you get 25 images for $1 on flux pro and all
11/8/24, 16:51 - +91 81044 28406: it is faster than open AI dall e tho
11/8/24, 17:52 - +91 63695 89236: Ya alternative is fal.ai = pricing is similar

11/11/24, 16:34 - +91 97898 20475: Yeah I know bro there are lots of services which offer llm endpoints based on credits 

But I want to learn how to host the base llm models 

Like how much vram required for a particular model 

What GPU I need to buy to host the modal 

Etc .....
11/11/24, 16:34 - +91 97898 20475: If there is any course to learn this pls suggest
11/11/24, 18:40 - +91 63695 89236: You can get a gaming gpu nvidia 3060 (around 28k inr) it's a decent gpu but still much slower than gpus built for llm.But should be good enough for u to host local models for learning. 

H100 tensor core is optimized for llm but much more expensive and not even sure if available in India
11/11/24, 18:41 - +91 63695 89236: For learning u need not buy gpu. From what ur saying at your stage just top up 10$ into a cloud service and learn there. Will be faster. Then once u feel u need to go deeper u can invest more
11/11/24, 18:41 - +91 63695 89236: Always think about where u are and go one step at a time. Don't try to prematurely optimize everything and get stuck in analysis paralysis
11/11/24, 18:55 - +91 97898 20475: Ok noted
11/11/24, 19:07 - +91 91082 87982: Free credit from AWS and azure
11/11/24, 19:21 - +91 98338 42749: It is all hidden. I struggled for 6 months to understand how much GPU is required for different LLMs. There is no clear material or course available online. Best way is to catch someone from GPU sales who can help you with this. They deal regularly with different clients with different requirements.

Basically claude provides the best, Just in time knowledge to make better informed decisions.
11/12/24, 16:47 - +91 63695 89236: based on stealing indian data. sad. indian startup should be doing this. we are selling out in all ways. short term wise is ok but not good for long term.
11/12/24, 16:59 - +91 90290 81083: I'm obviously missing some context here... Do tell if possible
11/12/24, 17:00 - +91 7397 360 520: If we consider about data getting captured.. Then all the gmail content and google search, anything you do with Google is read and used by Google. <This message was edited>
11/12/24, 17:01 - +91 7397 360 520: Stealing would be too harsh of a term to use.
11/12/24, 17:12 - +91 88103 86510: Not just google, most of the apps gather as much data as they can. Also the companies themselves sell data to third party. Even the banks sell your data to insurance, loan providers etc .
11/12/24, 17:12 - +91 63695 89236: Ok let me explain.

Take the example of google and facebook. They setup their platforms in india and now due to strong network effects they are irreplaceable by pure market dynamics (unless the govt bans them). 

The power that they have is their data. 

Lets say I am an indian startup wanting to sell to indian customers online. 

I have to use facebook ads, google ads, etc to stay on top of the game (because all my competition is using it).

Hence our money is flowing out of the country rather than staying inside (bad for country).  Ironic thing is much of their top staff is indian but indians own NO IP. 

If for some reason fb doesnt like me and bans me, my business will be severely affected. So a foreign company now has unbalanced power over indian companies. 
These corps pay little to no tax in india. Furthermore, they force us to comply with their policy (we already have many examples of how chatgpt is racist towards indians and hindus). 

Hence we are forced to play by their rules and pay them money if we want to succeed in india. Do you see the problem with this now? one may argue this is a form of digital colonization. 

Same way, elevenlabs will pay villagers in india pennies to get their data to train their model and sell it back to indian software companies at a premium price. 

We cant blame the company personally they are just doing business. 

We can blame our own govt and companies lack of vision and long term outlook. <This message was edited>

11/12/24, 17:26 - +27 82 775 8235: access to free means you are the data
11/12/24, 17:33 - +91 7397 360 520: elevenlabs will pay villagers in india pennies to get their data - I'm actually up for this.. 

In India, a significant corruption happens because humans are the barrier/medium/interface to avail any service. Humans have bias and have greed, people who are uneducated dont have the ability to navigate through the paper has to go through humans, and the people who are at power can exploit them. 

but if there is a voice interface, where the system communicates with a Tamil Guy in Tamil, Bengali in Bengali, The people at receiving end can navigate through complex systems easily.  

Because people are illiterate and not illogical. i.e People can't read/write but most of them can speak. 

So, A company like 11 labs with good data would help in our use case. 

__

Or, some Indian company can foresee this and help, but unlikely to happen.
